			 <p>Japan’s &ldquo;Privacy Mark&rdquo; system had a serious security breach in Aug 2023, and its operator JIPDEC (Japan Information Technology and Social Promotion Association) <a href="https://www.jipdec.or.jp/news/pressrelease/20231113.html">announced the results of an investigation</a> into the matter. 🕵🏻‍♂️</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When companies implement P-Mark, there are a number of requirements to be met, similar to what organizations go through when trying for an ISO certification. Reviewers for JIPDEC are responsible for auditing the certification applications, and one such reviewer had saved review documents on an unsecured personal NAS. A P-Mark holder contacted JIPDEC saying review documents were visible on the internet. That had to sting.</p>
<p>The subsequent investigation showed that leaked information included review documents for applicants, emails and addresses variously of staff, applicants and certification holder companies.</p>
<p>It’s obviously a grave situation for a standards organization to be caught with their proverbial pants down like this, but to JIPDEC’s credit they are showing how seriously they are taking it by banning reviewers from using personal devices for performing reviews. At least it’s a step in the right direction.</p>
<p><em>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</em> In the case of JIPDEC, I guess their customers do. I wish them well while they, um, re-apply for their own P-Mark cert. 😅</p>

<li>A <a href="https://webhook.site">webhook.site</a> subscription that lets me schedule custom scripts that can handle json</li>
</ul>
<p>… so I should be able to parse my json, and ping indexnow for any URLs added in the last day, so that if I schedule a daily script run, it will submit just those.</p>
<p>To get set up I followed the steps over on Bing’s <a href="https://www.bing.com/indexnow">indexnow page</a>. First you need to create a file on your site. In micro.blog I edited my custom theme, and added a new template under <code>static</code>. If the API key is <code>47e6f02ccea743bf</code> , then you create a file called <code>47e6f02ccea743bf.txt</code>, and add <code>47e6f02ccea743bf</code> to the body of the file.</p>
<p>The existence of this file serves as proof you own the site, and once published, should be available at:</p>
<pre><code>https://mysite.com/47e6f02ccea743bf.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Now when you have a new or updated URL, you can ping by accessing this API:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.bing.com/indexnow?url=https://mysite.com/path/to/newpost.html&amp;key=47e6f02ccea743bf
</code></pre>
<p>As for automation, I tried various things, but in the end got help from Simon, the owner of <code>webhook.site</code>. You can set up a script there, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span>

<p>This assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>your <code>feed.json</code> is structured like <a href="https://cogley.jp/feed.json">mine</a></li>
<li>you registered the api key file so indexnow can find it</li>
<li>you also want to ping &ldquo;ping-o-matic&rdquo; about the presence of changes</li>
</ul>
<p>What the script does is, loops through the &ldquo;items&rdquo; node checking all the &ldquo;date published&rdquo; values against the difference between now and that date, and if the interval is less than 86400 (seconds in a day), then it will hit the indexnow API with those URLs. As a last step, it pushes the rss feed to ping-o-matic.</p>
<p>Once it’s working, to trigger it you can schedule it, or, just bookmark and periodically access your webhook.site url, which will look something like: <code>https://webhook.site/#!/a9f864e4-3506-4a13-943d-c5696e9e1eb8</code>. I scheduled mine because I’m updating every day, but if I wasn’t, I’d just bookmark the webhook.site URL and hit that any time I made a new post.</p>
<p>Manton got &ldquo;lastmod&rdquo; working on micro.blog posts, so I can now update my json feed to include the modified timestamp, and check also for recently modified posts. I’ll do that and report back.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to do the same thing, from shell scripts to iOS shortcuts, probably. Perhaps Google will even participate in this system one day.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>20231108</strong> - Ok, after observing the script for a couple days, it is indeed picking up the new posts as expected, so the schedule and script is working as expected. Updated the wording to make it clear that the script is searching for new posts, not modified ones.</li>
<li><strong>20231109</strong> - Mentioned that modified date is now working so that can be added and tested.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Perhaps ten years ago I bought BeyerDynamic T90 headphones, which I love and which have served me well <em>every single day</em>, but they are just falling apart from wear<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, so I was looking for an appropriate replacement. I found new &lsquo;phones from <a href="https://ashidavox.com/">AshidaVox</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> with great cost performance that I’ll share in this review from my perspective as an audio layperson. 🎧</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-5248.jpg" alt="Wired Headphones from AshidaVox sitting on a tenugui cloth. "></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="background-and-decision-making">Background and Decision-making</h3>
<p>I’m attracted to wireless headphones and IEMs that connect via Bluetooth, but I have not had good luck with reliability so far, with AirPods or wireless IEM’s of any flavor, so I thought I would look for something good which is also a <em>wired</em> model, for listening to music, podcasts and watching Netflix etc around the home. Maybe I&rsquo;m just old, but it’s less annoying to not have to recharge anyway.</p>
<p>I prefer to support the local economy if I can, because I live and work in Japan, so for this purchase I decided to try to find made-in-Japan headphones, and go with a wired model. Researching here and there <em>e.g.</em> on the <a href="https://e-earphone.jp/">e-earphone</a> site, I learned about <a href="https://tagostudio.com/headphones/">Tago Studio</a> and <a href="https://ashidavox.com/">AshidaVox</a>; two domestic makers of headphones. Tago is recently well regarded overseas, while AshidaVox is well known for its famous ST-31 model especially<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I’m no expert, but the models from Tago Studio, aside from being more expensive than AshidaVox, are apparently tuned for work in a music studio by pros who work in a music studio. I gather that you want separate headphones for that kind of work, as opposed to simply listening to music for pleasure. The higher end Tago’s were raved about on English-speaking sites, for example, and they cost about JPY 65,000. This isn’t that expensive in headphone land, where some really high end headphones sell for 300 to 600K, but it’s 3x the price of the AshidaVox.</p>
<h4 id="on-ashidavox">On AshidaVox</h4>
<p>Paraphrasing their <a href="https://www.ashida.co.jp/en/company/index.html">website</a>, Ashida Onkyo (&ldquo;Sound&rdquo;) was founded in 1924 (Taisho 13) from the original Ashida Company, the general agent of Magnavox for the Far East region, and switched from importing speakers from the US to producing them domestically, when US-Japan relations deteriorated in 1942. The brand &ldquo;AshidaVox&rdquo; has been in use from 1925 until today, representing quality audio speakers and headphones, for almost 100 years!</p>
<h3 id="deciding-on-the-ashidavox-st-31-02">Deciding on the AshidaVox ST-31-02</h3>
<p>The <strong>AshidaVox ST-31-02</strong> model that I ended up getting, was released on 1st Oct 2023, and cost about JPY 22,000 before tax (with ST-31-02 replacement ear pads available for JPY 2,090). They made <em>only 200 units</em> to start. I read some reports before my purchase that they were great cost-performance, tuned to sound good with various types of music, and despite being &ldquo;closed back&rdquo; type, they have a good &ldquo;sound stage&rdquo;, so, that sounded good enough for me given the low price.</p>
<p>E-earphone’s <a href="https://e-earphone.blog/?p=1477396">blog</a> states (as does AshidaVox’s product release blurb) that the ST-31-02 is the second generation of the famous ST-31 used in many recording studios in the &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s. Paraphrasing, they explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The speaker cone paper that was the heart of the sound was no longer made, so the original model eventually went out of production. However due to a passionate user base, AshidaVox re-released this updated version for general music appreciation purposes. They developed a special Φ 50 mm speaker driver, and while keeping the original flavor of the ST-31, they made the bass deeper and the highs more comfortable, while controlling some unpleasant resonances, giving the product a clear sound signature without muddiness. They are made one by one in Japan with a craftsman’s dexterity and sincerity, without affect, and to a consistently high level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BeyerDynamic T90 headphones I have been using are &ldquo;open back&rdquo; which means they leak sound and might not be appropriate for night use at home or any public use, but, a lot of people like the &ldquo;open&rdquo; design, because it sounds bigger or more airy. The AshidaVox ST-31-02 model is closed, so there is a lot less sound leakage which is probably better for my living situation. If I can get my T90’s repaired I’ll compare.</p>
<p>One criticism I read about the ST-31-02 is that the cord is short, at 1.5m, but, for my usage this is just right. The shortness is a plus for me. The T90 has a 3m cord and it gets tangled up into a weighty mass of excess cable. If I add a USB DAC in-line for a little boost, that adds just a bit of length as well.</p>
<p>In addition, the ST-31-02’s low impedance of <code>26Ω</code> means I can drive them directly from an iPhone or iPad. In comparison, the T90s have an impedance of <code>250Ω</code>, meaning you really need to put them through an amp so they will sound good.</p>
<p>All that said, I decided on the ST-31-02’s because they fit my usage and come from a reputable maker, and in my opinion, they sound great!</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>The purpose of these headphones is to use them around the house for listening to relaxing music during work, or listening to podcasts or lectures, and watching some streaming service videos before bed. I’m certainly not so knowledgeable about audio, and just want headphones to sound &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, so I experimented with some settings for my usage pattern.</p>
<p>If you are interested in testing for yourself, you can copy the settings I made in iPhone and iPad iOS 17.1:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settings, Music, Audio section</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dolby Atmos</strong> - always on<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Lossless</strong> - on for Wi-Fi streaming</li>
<li><strong>EQ</strong> - various, change to suit the music</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the above settings, I tried the ST-31-02’s with and without an amp and they sounded good either way.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Changing the above mentioned EQ setting really helps as well.</p>
<p>The look and feel is quality, but has a sort of retro feel. If &ldquo;modern&rdquo; is slick CNC’ed smoothness, then these look more like a craftsman made them, and maybe they are just a touch old fashioned. The cups look like painted fiberglass, and you get the feeling they would be right at home in a factory or a school. Personally I’m kind of &ldquo;Showa&rdquo; anyway, and I really like it. They feel solid in the hands and snug when worn.</p>
<h3 id="specifications">Specifications</h3>
<p>Here’s the maker specs, translation mistakes mine:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By comparison the T90 headphones have an impedance of <code>250Ω</code> meaning they work better with an amp, a sensitivity of <code>102 dB</code>, and a frequency response of <code>5-40,000 Hz</code>.</p>
<p>So far I really like these AshidaVox headphones and am satisfied about the purchase. I’ll update after I use them for a month or two.</p>
<p>Happy listening! 🎧</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>20231103</strong> - Corrected that AshidaVox is not known overseas; they are. Edited for better flow and added some sections to break up the wall of text. Tried the headphones for a couple hours last night listening to various genres and EQ settings, and I still like them. They were not tiring to use and the &ldquo;snug&rdquo; fit I mentioned wasn’t a problem for me.</li>
<li><strong>20231104</strong> - I had AshidaVox incorrectly written as &ldquo;AudioVox&rdquo; in a few places (d’oh!), fixed. Added other names for the AshidaVox company.</li>
<li><strong>20231107</strong> - Added a little AshidaVox history - they’re almost 100 years old!</li>

			 <p>On Saturday 28 Oct 2023, my daughter K and I drove out to Yamanashi prefecture, for a ~10km hike at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Daibosatsu">Mt. Daibosatsu</a> (&ldquo;Daibosatsurei&rdquo; 大菩薩嶺 2057m). The hike took about 6 hours, with about 650m of ascent and descent from parking 4 down by the lake. A fantastic day, and the 6 hours of driving was well worth it.</p>

<h3 id="daibosatsurei-background">Daibosatsurei Background</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Daibosaturei&rdquo; is one of the &ldquo;100 Mountains of Japan&rdquo; (after Kyuya Fukada’s book), located in Yamanashi Prefecture in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichibu_Tama_Kai_National_Park">Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park</a> (in the &ldquo;Kai&rdquo; part), straddling Koshu City and Kitatsurugun, and feeding the Tama and Fuefuki rivers. Here, hiking season is May, and Oct/Nov.</p>
<p>People learned the origin of the mountain’s name from the Records of Kai Province (&ldquo;Kai Koku Shi&rdquo; 甲斐国志), where it’s written that Minamoto No Yoshimitsu got lost on the mountain, and a wood cutter led him to safety, but suddenly vanished<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Yoshimitsu is said to have prayed to the Bodhisatva (Daibosatsu) Hachiman <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to give thanks for saving his life.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>We left Yokohama just before 5am in the dark, but the two hour drive according to Google Maps took three, and when we arrived around 8am, parking lots 1, 2, and 3 were full, and we were directed to lot 4 down by the lake. Fortunately there was a &ldquo;porta-potty&rdquo; style toilet in the lot, so we used that and headed up road and trail to get to the trail head proper.</p>
<p>The hike started in quite an idyllic fashion, walking on a groomed trail with a gentle slope, over wooden deck structures through a lovely forest with bird song and the &ldquo;waka waka&rdquo; call of squirrels. We noticed our cell signals were quite weak here, and could not start our Yamap apps to record at first. It eventually worked as we walked along.</p>
<p>In fifteen minutes or so, we arrived at Lodge Chobei<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> (<a href="http://www.choubei.info/">ロッジ長兵衛</a>), where the parking lot we’d wanted to use was. Here, we bought Daibosatsurei badges for our collection, and proceeded on our way, but they have food and other souvenirs as well. There’s also a public toilet nearby, which I marked on my <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1MVXMB1gmaA-UywbQtQVnfh7Gnc5pZ4w&amp;usp=sharing">annotated map</a>.</p>
<p>The trailhead is &ldquo;Kami-hikawa Touge&rdquo; (上日川峠), &ldquo;touge&rdquo; being mountain pass. This is the name used for the first part of the north-east-bound route up Daibosatsurei, for three (free) parking lots nearby, for the bus stop, and for the dam down near where we parked. Triers should note, the trail head is about 19 or 20km from Chuo Expressway Katsunuma IC by car on a narrow winding road, or by the number 14 bus bound for Kamihikawa Touge, from JR Chuo Kai-Yamato station. It’s an hour whether you’re driving or taking the bus.</p>
<p>From the trailhead, it’s not far to &ldquo;Fukuchan-sou&rdquo; (副ちゃん荘, where &ldquo;sou&rdquo; indicates lodging), and the hike is similar to the first part - easy going, on packed dirt with leaves, pine needles, and some roots. Fukuchan-sou also has food and souvenirs, and a plaque on the outside of the facility states that the (at that time in 2002) Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako rested here during their hike up to Daibosatsurei. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Kyuya Fukada’s &ldquo;100 mountains&rdquo; book gained popularity because the (now) Emperor mentioned enjoying it.</p>
<h3 id="our-route-up-karamatsu-ridge">Our Route Up: Karamatsu Ridge</h3>
<p>Fukuchan-sou marks what’s called the &ldquo;Karamatsu-one&rdquo; (唐松尾根, where &ldquo;one&rdquo; is ridge) Junction, where there’s a public toilet, and where you can elect to go up to the summit clock-wise via Karamatsu Ridge or counter-clockwise via Daibosatsu Pass. After a brief rest and use of the facilities, we turned left here and went up Karamatsu Ridge, because the views are probably better that way and you tax your legs on the steeper part, while they are fresh, and have a more gentle descent.</p>
<p>One thing we noticed is, from right around Fukuchan-sou, the trail gradually turns gravelly, then it changes to a bed of small rocks, which continues pretty much the whole way. I saw a couple people wearing regular sneakers, but you’re going to end up with pretty bruised feet if you do that. Proper hiking boots are recommended on this hike.</p>
<p>The Karamatsu ridge route gets steeper as you go along, and there were a couple spots where I needed to use my hands for stability as I clambered up, and some areas that were simply just crowded with people in what felt like a queue, but there was nothing that was overly risky. A couple people even brought their dogs (even a French bulldog in a halloween costume).</p>
<h3 id="lunch-at-lightning-rock--daibosatsurei-summit">Lunch at Lightning Rock &amp; Daibosatsurei Summit</h3>
<p>Eventually you get to what <em>looks</em> like the summit, but it’s actually the &ldquo;Rai-iwa&rdquo; (雷岩 lightning rock). This is where we stopped for lunch.</p>
<p>Due to the crowds, there weren’t really any smooth rocks to sit on, so we got our sit pads out (recommended!) and made do, boiling some water for instant soup. Rice balls and soup were quaffed while we took in the gorgeous view, and did some people watching, listening to the various languages of the tourist hikers.</p>
<p>From the Rai-iwa, it’s a short jaunt to the summit, where the views are definitely not so great, kind of obscured by trees. A fellow trekker offered to take our photo by the summit marker, so we took him up on that. Now we earned the badges we bought at the foot of the mountain. Back at Rai-iwa, we climbed up on top of the rock crag for the wonderful view to the south, paused a few moments, then started our descent via Daibosatsu Touge (大菩薩峠).</p>
<h3 id="the-descent-via-daibosatsu-touge">The Descent via Daibosatsu Touge</h3>
<p>Daibosatsu Touge is a &ldquo;saddle ridge&rdquo; pass extending about 2km south-southeast ward from Daibosaturei, and affords hikers just <em>stunning</em> views of the surrounding area, as well as mountains such as Kurodake, Genjirodake, and of course the famous Fuji. This day, Fuji was under a bit of cloud cover, but we got some fleeting glimpses of her mass. Part way down, the view opens up and you can see all the way to where the pass summit is marked, at Kaizan-sou lodge.</p>
<p>Daibosatsu Touge is the name of an unfinished 41-episode serialized novel by Kaizan Nakazato (中里介山), from whom the Kaizan-sou lodge gets its name. The novel is said to be popular even today, and was published in national papers from 1913 to 1941 <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, telling the story of a murderous swordsman. It was given a dramatization in the eponymous 1966 film, translated as &ldquo;The Sword of Doom&rdquo; in English. Search and you’ll find a few videos on YouTube including an old trailer.</p>
<h3 id="sudden-weather">Sudden Weather</h3>
<p>During our descent, around &ldquo;Kanbe-iwa&rdquo; (神部岩)<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> , K asked &ldquo;did you feel that? It’s starting to rain.&rdquo; It seemed like rain at first, and as it started to come down, it became clear it was hail. Eventually it got strong enough that we decided to layer up in rain gear, and cover our packs. The line of hikers on the trail all paused at once to do the same thing. It was odd, because we could see the sun across the valley, but were right inside this cold weather. Goes to show, you need to be ready for anything in the mountains.</p>
<p>Just before we got to Daibosatsu Touge, the weather was already clearing up and people were coming out of an emergency shelter. Probably there was no need for it today, but it is nice to know it’s there if you need it. The name is a little disconcerting, &ldquo;Sai-no-kawara&rdquo; (さいの河原), the riverbank in Buddhist canon where Jizo Bodhisatva helps children who died too early avoid evil spirits so they can cross over.</p>
<p>Finally we arrived at the Daibosatsu Touge 1897m elevation marker and Kaizan-sou, where you can have a break, buy some souvenirs, or use the public toilet. There are two ways down from there, one further south to Mt. Kumazawa and back, but we elected to take a hard right before the toilets, to take the shorter easterly route past Fujimi-sou (富士見荘), and back to Fukuchan-sou.</p>
<h3 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h3>
<p>There are some steep areas on the way down, but nothing too hard, and it really gets easier and easier as you get closer to the junction at Fukuchan-sou, with some lovely autumn colors and scenes. From there, it was an easy hike back to the parking lot, where we worried it was going to be impossible to get out, due to how people had randomly parked. We were one of the first cars in lot 4 in the AM, so we were waaay back in the corner of this lot.</p>
<p>We found a day-use onsen called <a href="http://www.daibosatsu-kankou.com/facility/yamato_tenmoku_hotspring.php">Yamato-tenmoku</a>, chucked it in the navi, and it was a welcome rest after our hike. It took 30 or 40 min to drive there, and we had a scrub and a soak<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, a snack, and were on our way home for a big meal. All in all, it was a really lovely day!</p>

			 <p>One funny day: I was out with a client near Motomachi Yokohama, at a warehouse that was a prospect for the client&rsquo;s logistics operations in Japan. The contract was a fairly nice chunk of business, valuing a couple hundred thousand USD per month.</p>
<p>The meeting was a hysterical failure. It was August, super hot and humid as usual for Japan, but the warehouse meeting room <em>had no AC</em> and they insisted we wear construction helmets, and to add insult to injury, would not give us any water. The sweat was rolling off us as we tried to keep from collapsing, while we waited for it to start.</p>
<p>It was typical for meetings of this type in Japan: on the foreigner side there was myself and three C-Level types from the US. On the vendor side, it was something like 20 people. Their team were supposed to present in English, but started in on a presentation in Japanese with no sign of any interpretation. After a few minutes and no sign of English, I reminded them of their promise to present in English, and after a very uncomfortable few minutes and whispered discussion, they tried to corral <em>me</em> into doing it.</p>
<p>My stance was, &ldquo;Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s not happening. I&rsquo;m here on the client&rsquo;s behalf, not yours. You mean to tell me of all 20 of you, nobody actually read the email between your Tanaka san and us over the last month? We were clear on what our requirements were…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long story short, they were unprepared to present in English, and finally dragged a junior marketing person in, who &ldquo;speaks perfect English&rdquo; to do ad hoc interpreting. It was just, comically bad, so much so that I felt like I should assist to try to salvage the meeting, but our team was just wanting to cut it short and go on the tour of the facility. I think their minds were already made up, and we were sweating and parched and wanting to get out of there.</p>
<p>The tour was also bad, because the vendor was insisting on questions in writing during the tour (I mean, what?!), not verbally, and continued to blithely present everything in Japanese. Anyway, the whole thing kind of fizzled once we saw how generally incompetent they were from top to bottom. (The winner of the business by contrast, was really, really good, but, it makes for a less funny story, for sure!)</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s after this disaster ended and we left, that the fun started. There&rsquo;s a beer factory near Motomachi, so two of us went there and did a tour. Had a couple beers on the tour before dinner, then went to dinner had some more. We went to JR Motomachi, and were standing there trying to decide what sort of Strong Zero and snacks to get for the train ride, and this dude saunters up to us.</p>
<p>He looked like one of those movie Yakuza, with full-on white kimono, white shoes, missing digits, deep tan. He was probably in his 50s, about 10 years older than us at the time. He started talking to us in drunk, broken-but-good-enough English: &ldquo;welcome Japan. I buy drink present for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked so scary we were starting to freak out a bit, but he bought us some shochu type drinks and snacks from the Kiosk, gave them to us in a bag and was asking us questions about where we are from and so on.</p>
<p>Then he started to retch, and cough-vomited up a ramen noodle, that lobbed end-over-end until it landed splat on my client&rsquo;s lapel! Thing is, he was so drunk he didn&rsquo;t even really notice, so we just said thanks, stifling disgust and laughter, brushing the vomitus off my friend&rsquo;s lapel, grabbed our shochu&rsquo;s and snacks and retreated into the station through the turnstile.</p>
<p>When I see my client friend, we always recount the &ldquo;flying ramen vomit incident&rdquo; with gestures and SFX. It was an unforgettable experience. 🍜🤢</p>

			 <p><em>German swings</em> scare the bejeezus out of me. Do you know what those are?</p>
<p>When I was a kid in the 1970’s, we used to go to the shore every couple of years, mostly Nags Head, North Carolina. You’d see temporary carnivals here and there, so naturally us kids wanted to ride and we’d beg our parents to let us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;German swings&rdquo; are seats attached to or hung from the outer edge of a large rotating disc by chains. You pull up the bar and sit in the seat, and as the big carousel disc rotates, centrifugal force causes you to swing outward. I have no idea if they came from Germany with the many immigrants to the US, or if it’s some kind of pejorative against Germans, but anyway, we loved them and usually it was a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>One time we were on one, and the operator (a teenager, iirc) left the ride site presumably to use the toilet, but the ride went on and on, and riders were starting to get sick, so parents went to find the operator. When he finally came back, he stopped the ride in a panicked way, kind of jamming on the brakes, and the swings wrapped around the middle of the ride, banging us into the center column once, then unwrapping and banging us again.</p>
<p>Luckily I had the presence of mind to pull my arms in tight because there were definitely injured riders. It was terrifying.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t look at one of those without feeling anxious. 🎡⚠️</p>

			 <p>A photo from a couple years ago, on the bike path between Yamato and Fujisawa. Getting a flat then having to change a tube in the cold or hot is not fun, and if you use compressed air, the little cylinder gets cold enough to injure you. Always be prepared in biking or hiking. 🚴🏻‍♂️📷</p>

			 <p>On Sunday 3 Sept 2023, I did a 6hr solo point-to-point hike in Hakone, ascending 903m up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_My%C5%8Djin_(Kanagawa)">Myojingatake</a> (明神が岳, 1169m) from Daiyuzan <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%80%E4%B9%97%E5%AF%BA">Saijoji Temple</a> (大雄山最乗寺 aka Doryoson), and descending 719m to Miyagino (宮城野) on Rt. 138, traveling over about 9km. From there I took the bus down to Kami-to-no-sawa (上塔ノ沢), then walked to an onsen for a scrub and a soak.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/fa16ac9a-f82b-4d5a-955e-2e3f484b2baf-1724-00000192526852e7.jpg" alt="Photo of Hakone mountains from the top of Mt Myojin"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I <a href="https://cogley.jp/2023/08/19/mt-myojogatake-hiking.html">hiked up Myojogatake</a>, I had intended to go up Myojingatake as well, but I was tired that day and opted out. In looking at various routes up today’s peak, I picked the route coming from the northeast, from the lovely and sprawling temple complex at Saijoji.</p>
<p>As usual, I wanted to start out early to be off the mountain around noon, so I left at 4:30am, got to Odawara before 6:00am, and was at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiy%C5%ABzan_Station">Daiyuzan</a> station, the last stop on the Izu Hakone Tetsudo line, by about 6:20am. To my surprise, the buses up to Saijoji start around 9am, so, I used the public toilet outside the station, then checked the map for how far it would be to walk to Saijoji (about 3km). Fortunately a taxi pulled in, so I took advantage and got a ride up the road. The taxi driver was talkative, regaling me with his own hiking adventures, but we arrived within 15 min.</p>
<p>There’s two more-or-less parallel routes up Myojingatake, both proceeding in the southwest direction from Saijoji. One starts at the Saijoji entrance, off to the left immediately; the other from the back of the complex, after you pass through it. I chose to go through the temple complex and take the more north of the two routes. It was a bit tougher to find the actual trail, but Yamareco kept me on track.</p>
<p>The temple complex is really beautiful, but there are <em>so</em> many steps. I counted about 220 or 230 steps on only the last staircase. There were plenty more before that. After you get on the trail, it’s a cedar forest for most of the way to the top along a ridgeline. The trail is packed dirt with some rocks and roots. It was misty in the early morning, and as I was marveling at the view in one spot, I heard a rustle, and turned to find a doe about 3 meters away. She regarded me, and I regarded her, as I took some snaps and a quick video, then she ran off just as soon as she had come into view. That, and the fog made the hike feel quite magical.</p>
<p>A couple of spots during the ascent are not well marked. I mistakenly headed up a river bed at one, but realized something was off, doubled back, and went up a steeper route to the left which turned out to be right. Another spot was just open forest area where you could barely see the trail. In either case, it helped to look at the <a href="https://www.yamareco.com/">Yamareco</a> app, which has a clear indicator of which direction you should be proceeding, and even lets you know if you veer off.</p>
<p>After the long ascent, I got to what was marked as the summit on the map, but there was no placard or any kind of sign that I was in the right place, so I got a bit worried I was off track. I kept going though, and finally got to a kind of picnic area a few meters below, which had signs and explanations of what should be visible. I didn’t have luck seeing Mt. Fuji again, but I could at least see <a href="https://cogley.jp/2023/07/24/kintoki-hike-in.html">Mt. Kintoki</a> in the foreground (Fuji should have been visible behind it).</p>
<p>I took a short break at the picnic tables, then started descending, eventually merging with the same route as I took when I hiked Myojogatake a few weeks before. As I mentioned in that post, you see signs for the Miyagino Annaijo bus stop and toilet as you get close to the road. I waited a few minutes for a bus bound for Hakone Yumoto, headed down about 15 min or so, then got off at Kami-Tonosawa bus stop. From there I walked a little bit up to <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/" title="Hakone Yuryo">Hakone Yuryo</a>, my oft-frequented day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal.</p>
<p>Hakone Yuryo runs a shuttle bus to and from Hakone Yumoto station, so I took advantage of that to get to Hakone Yumoto afterwards, then took the funicular to Odawara and took the JR train back home.</p>
<p>A couple days after this hike, a retired police and experienced hiker friend told me they used Myojingatake for mountain training when he was in the police academy. He said that a respected older officer suddenly fell dead when they were on a training hike there one day, and that he has never forgotten that incident, burned into his young brain at the time. That was a bit chilling to hear, but it just reminds you that you need to be prepared and ready for anything in the mountains.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://cogley.jp/2023/09/20/old-tokaido-hike.html">Old Tokaido Hike in Hakone</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On Monday 18 Sept 2023, on Respect-for-the-Aged day, I did a 5hr solo point-to-point hike in Hakone, up the &ldquo;old Tokaido&rdquo; and &ldquo;old Hakone Town&rdquo; roads, ascending 752m and descending 119m over 10.7km. This was not up a single mountain <em>per se</em>, but was plenty tiring going up a very long slope, as the humidity is still hanging around even in September. The hike started in Hakone Yumoto, then followed the road then trails all the way up to Lake Ashi. From there, I got the bus back toward Yumoto, stopping off part way along, to scrub off the trail dirt and have a dip in the onsen.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I got to JR Odawara a bit before 6am and was hiking at Hakone Yumoto by 6:40am, and the first 3 kilometers or so are over road, up route 732. You see Yumoto receding on the right as you ascend. Getting to rt 732 proper required some peering at the map, but once you’re on it, you just have to keep an eye out for some landmarks.</p>
<p>After many bus stops, as you’re nearing the trailhead, you pass a rather colorful temple that reminds one of those in Nikko, the Hakone Dai-tengu, then a hotel on the right, followed by the Sukumogawa IC highway intersection. Another couple hundred meters along, and you’ll see Sagumodera Temple on the left, which has a small waterfall and a water spout for purification next to the road. The Sukumogawa Nature Trail trail head is soon after, also on the left.</p>
<p>At the trail head, you’ll see a sign for the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.hakone-geopark.jp/area-guide/hakone1/006sekisyotoisidatami.html">Hakone Geo-park</a>&rdquo; explaining a bit about the area, and from there, you ascend a bit then basically descend to the river, where you can cross over a narrow wooden footbridge near the Tesco power station. There is also a suspension bridge about 100m upstream, if you’re not comfortable with the &ldquo;maruta-bashi&rdquo;. It was a bit wobbly and unstable, to be honest.</p>
<p>Once you’re over the bridge, you go up to rt 732 again near a shrine, then you’re going to proceed on the Old Tokaido or Old Hakone Town cobblestone roads. The first landmark is the rock that Goro Soga is said to have split with his sword to test its sharpness when seeking revenge, according to the sign. Some sections of the cobble paved roads are actually from the Edo period road started in c. 1603, so walking over those marked sections is a moving experience. Other cobblestone sections were destroyed during the massive &lsquo;quakes in 1923 and 1930, and were repaired after that, using the same road-making techniques.</p>
<p>There are many signs, some with English, that explain how the roads were built. I think that Roman architects would be suitably impressed. I can’t even imagine the amount of labor that building something like these roads would require, back when there was no heavy equipment to rely on. I mean, here I am struggling to just <em>walk</em> on the trail, much less haul large rocks all day. By the way, the cobbles were slippery in parts, so some care was needed. It would be more so, after a rain.</p>
<p>Eventually, as you proceed on and off the old Tokaido road and sometimes rt 732, you’ll get to Hatajuku, one of the old rest stops and so-called <em>ichirizuka</em> distance markers on the old Tokaido; the 23rd &ldquo;ri&rdquo; from Nihonbashi, to be exact.</p>
<p><em>As an aside, the distance markers on the old Tokaido were one &ldquo;ri&rdquo; apart, about 4km. Nihonbashi, where the old Tokaido started, would have therefore been about 92km from Hatajuku. The meter distances on the trail were marked in old style Japanese as bei 米.</em></p>
<p>Hatajuku is full of shops selling the famous Hakone Zaiku wooden <em>yosegi</em> marquetry, and there’s a clean public toilet that you can use before continuing up the trail.</p>
<p>The Tokugawa Shogunate designated 53 official &ldquo;Post Stations&rdquo; where you had to show a travel permit to pass when using the Tokaido. Hatajuku was apparently <em>not</em> one of those, just a rest area, but there are the official Hakone-juku and Odawara-juku nearby. There was also the <a href="https://www.hakonesekisyo.jp/">Hakone Checkpoint</a> that was a security gate, to control who left from or travelled to Edo, and you can visit a museum regarding that in present day near Ashinoko Lake, if you enjoy that history.</p>
<p>From Hatajuku, it’s more ascending up steps and cobblestone paths, and you’ll eventually come to the famous Amazake Chaya where you can take your well-earned break. The strawberry shaved ice with real strawberry chunks was really good, as was the iced matcha, and the atmosphere of the place was just really cool. Compared to the folks who drove there, I was obviously sweating from hiking, and probably didn’t smell that great. They gave me a special &ldquo;safe travels&rdquo; paper that they give to hikers, which I really appreciated. You can see it in the photo below.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes’ break in the Chaya, I completed the ascent, then descended to Ashinoko. I was looking for the Hakone Tozan bus back to Yumoto and one had just arrived, so I didn’t really linger. The bus to Yumoto passes Kami-Tonosawa, where I got off so I could have a soak in the usual <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/" title="Hakone Yuryo">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and took the JR train back home.</p>
<p>So, all in all I walked about 2.7 &ldquo;ri&rdquo; this day, which would have meant I passed by just two of the 128 &ldquo;ri&rdquo; distance markers on what was a 514km cobblestone road, with its 53 official overnight stations like &ldquo;Totsuka-juku&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hakone-juku&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>On Sunday 27 August 2023, I challenged myself to an approx 5:45hr 6.8km solo hike in the Tanzawa range on a hot and humid day (it suddenly rained at the end), ascending about 905m up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_%C5%8Cyama_(Kanagawa)">Mt. Oyama</a> starting in the shopping district around 7am, climbing up via the &ldquo;Onna-zaka&rdquo; (women’s slope) route to the summit, then descending about 630m down via Miharashidai to the &ldquo;Shimosha&rdquo; shrine area, and finally down by cable car.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-5241.jpg" alt="Pin badge from Mt. Oyama shop, showing elevation and the name in Japanese and English, depicting a shrine and deer in a forest scene."></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mt. Oyama is considered holy and has significant and interesting history. It’s also known as &ldquo;Afuri Yama&rdquo;, where &ldquo;Afuri&rdquo; refers to the rainy conditions, and &ldquo;Kunimi-yama&rdquo; the Guardian of the Land. The main shrine at the top is called &ldquo;Oyama Afuri Jinja Honsha&rdquo; (大山阿夫利神社 本社), and the one at the base near the top cable car station is &ldquo;Oyama Afuri Jinja Shimosha&rdquo; (大山阿夫利神社 下社), the &ldquo;lower shrine&rdquo;. There is also &ldquo;Oyama Dera&rdquo; a Buddhist Temple at the first stop on the cable car, half way up to the lower shrine.</p>
<p>It may be somewhat crowded and fairly &ldquo;commercialized&rdquo; but Oyama’s a challenging enough intermediate hike nevertheless. If you’re new to mountain trekking, try a smaller peak first, such as Takao or Hakone’s Kintoki, before attempting 1,252m Oyama. Indeed, and true to its &ldquo;Afuri Yama&rdquo; name, this hike was sunny until it suddenly started raining after I got down, but you should be prepared for weather, even in summer. Oyama is located in the Tanzawa-Oyama Quasi National Park in northwest Kanagawa prefecture, with over 38,000 hectares of forest with various mountain hikes, dams, rivers, waterfalls and so on, so if you want more of a challenge, you can try hikes such as To-no-dake and Mt. Tanzawa.</p>
<p>To be more specific, it’s partially about the meters of elevation difference that make a hike easier or harder. Hikes in the Kamakura Alps are over rolling hills, 100 or 200m in height, so you get maybe +/-200 or 300m or so over the course of the hike. When you start actual &ldquo;Tozan&rdquo; (mountain climbing, where the main point is ascending a single or multiple peaks), like at Takao in Tokyo, Kintoki in Hakone, or something like Kurobi in Gunma, you are doing +/-500 or 600m. Then you start doing hikes where you’ve chosen a trail that requires +/-800 to 1000. Tanzawa’s Oyama is one such, as is Hakone’s Sengen or Myojingatake. More difficult are peaks like To-no-dake and Mt. Tanzawa, which are near Oyama but are a 9-10 hour hike over 19km, with +/- 1600m. That’s significantly more difficult. You can have a look at my translation of <a href="https://cogley.jp/japan-mountain-hike-grading/">Japan’s mountain grading system</a>, to see how hikes are graded in Japan and what makes a hike challenging or risky.</p>
<p>So how was the trail? You start the climb by going up many, many stairs through a shopping district (where they sell famous Japanese top souvenirs) at the base of the mountain, stepping and stepping up to the cable car station, which wasn’t operating at 7am anyway. Once you get past the lower cable car station, you have a choice to make, between the feminine and masculine.</p>
<p>Our daughter recommended I take the &ldquo;Onna-zaka&rdquo; (女坂), or &ldquo;women’s slope&rdquo;, up to the lower shrine, because she said &ldquo;Otoko-zaka&rdquo; (男坂), or &ldquo;man’s slope&rdquo; is just too precarious with uneven and crumbling steps. It turns out the &ldquo;Onna-zaka&rdquo; is more interesting anyway, as you can visit Oyama temple which is not accessible from the &ldquo;Otoko-zaka&rdquo;, and, see the &ldquo;nana fushigi&rdquo; or &ldquo;seven curiosities&rdquo; like the childrearing o-Jizo, the relief statue that was carved by a monk using only his fingernails, or the silent bridge (bad luck to talk as you pass over), as well as see some &ldquo;power spots&rdquo; like the &ldquo;married couple cedars&rdquo; or Roben falls.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all culture. There were 山蛭 &ldquo;yamahiru&rdquo; mountain leeches, too. Well, I didn’t actually <em>see</em> any leeches, but there was a sign warning about them, and a tub of salt to use, to coat your socks and shoes with, so coat I did! A mountain-goer friend told me the Oyama area is one of the areas in Tanzawa with money, so they indeed take some measures against mountain leeches, but that other more backcountry destinations in Tanzawa don’t. He recalled he was shocked to find his shins all bloody one hike, from getting some of them on his shins. There’s even a nearby mountain called &ldquo;Mt. Leech&rdquo;, which, sounds like it’s not for the faint-hearted.</p>
<p>I took a break at the beautiful lower shrine, after having ascended the women’s slope. I said a prayer at the shrine, and looked around a little bit. One of many things that stood out was a statue of two school children, looking determined and pointing into what I assume is a bright future, which has an inscription 輝け杉の子 &ldquo;kagayake, Sugi no Ko&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Shine! Children of the Cedars!&rdquo; The sign said it commemorates the 40th anniversary of when about 3000 children evacuated to Oyama during WWII, were returned to their families. Poignant to think that some of these kids had nothing to return to.</p>
<p>From the &ldquo;Shimosha&rdquo; lower shrine, you start up what is now fewer stairs, and more trail, as you ascend to the summit. Recently a friend pointed out that the Tanazawa mountains were formed not by volcanic activity, but by tectonic plates pushing against each other, so the characteristic of the trail is a bit different. It’s not volcanic rock like Mt. Kintoki in Hakone, but more granite-like rocks between the roots and dirt. A little way after the lower shrine, there is a famous geological structure called the Botan Iwa 牡丹岩 or &ldquo;peony rocks&rdquo;, which is a big boulder structure you walk over, with round knobby protrusions between the size of a baseball and a softball, underfoot.</p>
<p>Further along, there were a couple of beautiful views already, where I took a break thinking I would have a protein bar or energy gel. I felt fear set in as I had made a dumb and potentially dangerous mistake. You can access Mt. Oyama via bus from Isehara station on the Odakyu, but I parked in the 2nd lot, just next to the shopping district. And that’s where I left the sports gels and protein bars and rice ball I’d bought for this hike. Luckily, our daughter had given me some 塩分チャージ &ldquo;enbun charge&rdquo; salt candy &ldquo;just in case you get overheated&rdquo; which is a sugar tablet packed with salt and minerals, so I had two of those until I got to the summit. I was humbled and grateful that Oyama is a bit commercialized with a &ldquo;Chaya&rdquo; tea shop at the top. There I bought curry rice and a sports drink, thanking my lucky stars as I ate, that I would not be in danger of bonking on the way down. I did have enough water and sports drink packed with me, but I hope I never forget my food again!</p>
<p>The route down was via &ldquo;Miharashidai&rdquo; which has a great view of Oyama itself and is a nice area to have a picnic, with a lot of picnic benches. There’s many signs on the way down, warning of either risk of slip/fall, or warning of falling rocks. The trail maintainers have affixed large steel cable nets to the mountain, especially where you’re navigating switchback as you descend. You can see that boulders have fallen into the nets, which was a little disconcerting. The app I use, Yamareco, showed a warning marker at one point (users can make a mark and explain why, which is visible on the trail in the app), saying that the trail was difficult to pass. There was a man and woman there that day, cutting trees that had fallen across the trail, using a handsaw. I got the go ahead and scrambled under on my hands and knees. Maybe that warning in the app will now disappear.</p>
<p>Near the end, there’s a pretty waterfall called 二重滝 &ldquo;nijutaki&rdquo; or &ldquo;double falls&rdquo;, near another shrine also with that name. From there, you actually ascend a little again, and you’re back at the lower shrine in no time at all.</p>
<p>Then, it was time to bust out my towel, which I sat on at a café while having a banana smoothie and a sausage. I was tired, so I chickened out of descending the &ldquo;Onna&rdquo; or &ldquo;Otoko&rdquo; slopes again, opting instead to take the cable car down past Oyama Temple, to the base. From there, it was back to the parking lot and back home.</p>

			 <p>The interesting and informative podcast &ldquo;Tell Me Something I Don&rsquo;t Know&rdquo; (TMSIDK) from Stephen Dubner, strikes me as a kind of antidote to &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; so common these days. 📣🎙️</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting format. In their own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell Me Something I Don’t Know is live journalism wrapped in a game-show package and hosted by Stephen J. Dubner, co-author of the Freakonomics books and host of Freakonomics Radio. Stephen has always had a mission: to tell you the things you thought you knew but didn’t; and things you never thought you wanted to know, but do. Now, he has a new way of doing just that. TMSIDK is still journalism, still factual — but disguised in the most entertaining, unexpected, and occasionally ridiculous conversation you’re likely to hear. Guests presenters come on stage before a live audience and try to wow Stephen and his co-host(s) with a fascinating fact, a historical wrinkle, a new line of research — anything, really, as long as it’s interesting, useful and true (or at least true-ish). There’s a real-time human fact-checker on hand to sort fact from fiction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I keep thinking it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;antidote&rdquo; to fake news in a sly way, because of the focus they bring to (admittedly <em>ad hoc</em>) fact checking, because a part of the game is to judge the &ldquo;IDKs&rdquo; participants present as fact, and because of how we get to observe the thought processes of some very smart people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real pleasurable listen, and you might like it too. The show has some serious heavy hitters as panelists. Check it out!</p>

			 <p>My business gets business because Japanese are not so good at English.</p>
<p>With apologies and respect to those Japanese who are fantastic speakers of English, my business <a href="https://esolia.com">eSolia</a> gets business because Japanese speak English poorly. We act as an ombudsman between overseas businesses and their branches based in Japan, and I tell you, it’s a challenge to find Japanese people who can fit our service model of having fluent English and technical skills.</p>
<p>Having watched my kids grow up in the school system here in Japan, there is such a strong focus on memorization, still, that there is just no way they could end up proficient in English.</p>
<p>You have to learn a language like a baby does - through sound and repetition. That&rsquo;s always where to start, not by slogging through soul-crushingly long, eyesight-destroying lists of English vocab. Kids in Japan got vocabulary, but it&rsquo;s all in their head. They mostly can&rsquo;t speak, because they <em>don&rsquo;t</em> speak in class. Their Japanese teachers are no better, with some foisting their awful, embarrassing pronunciation on their classes. I&rsquo;ve seen <em>that</em> nonsense first hand.</p>
<p>There are periodic articles in local English newspapers stating that English proficiency is poor, or scores or down, and so on. The Gov&rsquo;t of Japan has been paying lip service to better learning of English since I came here in 1987 (blergh, getting old here), but I&rsquo;ve seen only modest improvements. It&rsquo;s because of the irrational focus on rote memorization in my opinion.</p>
<p>When I have conference calls, I always wonder why other S.E. Asia countries’ English speakers are doing fine, and why Japan’s mostly aren’t. People from Singapore, Hong Kong, India all have &ldquo;accented&rdquo; English, but speak it fluidly and with confidence, generally.</p>
<p>I myself have an accent I reckon: an American one (or by now, maybe a Japanese one!). <em>Monbusho</em> just never change, do they? I think my business will still have opportunities from now and into the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On Saturday 12 August 2023, I did an approx 4hr 6.7km solo hike in Hakone on a humid day, ascending about 570m to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_My%C5%8Dj%C5%8D" title="Mt. Myojogatake">Mt. Myojogatake</a> (明星ヶ岳 みょうじょうがたけ 923m) from the Miyaginobashi bus stop, heading towards Mt. Myojingatake past the giant kanji cut into the mountain side for the o-bon festival, then down toward the Miyagino Annaijo bus stop.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mt Myojogatake is one of the stops on the gairin &ldquo;outer rim&rdquo; (外輪 がいりん) of Hakone, and you might meet trail runners attempting to complete that brutal course. If you’re a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; person with decent fitness, you&rsquo;ll find this hike up to Myojogatake just right. No need to attempt to run it! Although summer in Japan brings intense humidity and lots of pestering insects.</p>
<p>From the placard at the summit, you&rsquo;ll read it gets its name &ldquo;Myojo&rdquo; from Venus, the morning or evening star. It&rsquo;s also known as Mt. Kuno, from its vicinity to the Kuno district, and Mt. Daimonji, from the main event at the annual Hakone Gora summer festival held on Aug 16th at the end of o-bon, when a giant 10m wide &ldquo;dai&rdquo; kanji symbol, 大, cut into the side of the mountain, is set alight. After the initial ascent, I got passed by a young fellow carrying a gas-powered weed whacker on his shoulder, then later ran into him and two other older men with various gardening gear, who said they were cleaning up the giant 大 in preparation for the festival. I was glad for my desk job right about then, but also a little jealous of such a cool activity prepping for such an important cultural event.</p>
<p>The summit is pretty enough, with a manicured grassy open area (no toilet), and a small shrine next to the summit placard, but the views are not really spectacular. For that, hike to the next peak over, Mt. Myo-jin-gatake, or a little further on, to Mt. Kintoki. The views from the &ldquo;dai&rdquo; area are nice though, and you can see Gora, the ropeway, and Mt. Hakone and its surroundings quite well. To be honest, I just wanted to do a hike, so I picked this trail and this mountain, then figured out where I was when I got there. It was cool to learn where the giant 大 symbol is physically, see how it&rsquo;s maintained, and read a little about the mountain.</p>
<p>There were no &ldquo;paving stone&rdquo; sections like you see on the Yusaka or &ldquo;Old Kamakura&rdquo; trail from Yumoto up to Mt. Sengen, but otherwise the trail was typical for this area: hard pack dirt with a lot of roots and rocks, mostly larger ones, and some steps made from cut logs. Also, I saw a sign again and finally figured out what it meant. The sign says to scoop up even a handful of dirt from the &ldquo;water channel&rdquo;, and what is meant by that, is there are channels cut across the trail to allow water to pass, which get filled with dirt and silt. They are asking hikers to grab a handful and toss it aside, so I did. You can see the sign and said water channel in the photos.</p>
<p>The descent was uneventful except for one area where it was too much of a drop (for me) to maneuver myself down, so I dropped my poles and pack down onto a flat area, turned around, and somehow lowered myself down. I find fear creeping into my thoughts in these situations, so I know I won&rsquo;t be hiking something like Mt. Tsurugi anytime soon! You&rsquo;ll probably find trekking poles to be useful on the descent.</p>
<p>I was on the trail by 6:45am, and while there was a lot of bird song, which was pleasant, there were also a lot of flying insects this time. Some bees, some hornets, and some large flying insects which were really persistent; they looked like large flies with a white spot on their abdomen. A friend told me about a saying that goes something like &ldquo;the mountains are ours in the mornings but theirs at night.&rdquo; He said he started out on some Hakone trail around noon, and said he felt monkey eyes on him as he descended near dusk. Said it was a creepy experience he doesn&rsquo;t want to repeat. Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ll leave before sunrise in the future too.</p>
<p>As you get to the trail head after descending, you start seeing signs for the bus stop and public toilets. The Miyagino Annaijo bus stop maintains a public restroom, which I used before getting on the bus and heading down to Kami-Tonosawa bus stop. From there I walked a little bit up to <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/" title="Hakone Yuryo">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and took the JR train back home.</p>

			 <p>On Sunday 30 July 2023, I challenged myself with a ~10 km solo day hike in Hakone on a hot summer&rsquo;s day, ascending the Yusaka trail from Hakone Yumoto station, ascending 850m over about 7km to <a href="https://hakone-japan.com/discover/national-park/area-information/highlights/mt-sengen/">Mt Sengen</a> 802m (浅間山 せんげんさん) and Mt Takanosu 834m (鷹巣山 たかのすやま) with the (nonexistent) Takanosu Castle ruins, then descending 400m to the highlight, Chisuji Falls (千条の滝 ちすじのたき) at the 8.5km mark, and proceeding another couple of km over roads to Gora.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mts Sengen and Takanosu are related, in that Sengen used to be known as &ldquo;Lower Takanosu&rdquo; until the Edo Period. A Shinto shrine was built, and it was given the common name &ldquo;Sengen&rdquo; (also pronounced &ldquo;Asama&rdquo;) which you see here and there in Japan. There&rsquo;s one near where I live, a shrine on the highest hill around. When I decided on this hike, I was hoping to see something interesting historically, and while I read that Mt Takanosu is where the ruins of Takanosu castle are located, there&rsquo;s actually nothing there with the sign saying basically &ldquo;the castle was around here, somewhere&rdquo;. This castle is said to have been the Hojo Clan stronghold to protect against Toyotomi Hideyoshi&rsquo;s attack on Odawara in 1590 (Tensho 18), and since the sign at Mt Sengen also says Takanosu Castle was located there, perhaps both mountains were part of the fortifications.</p>
<p>At any rate, after ~7km of ascending over 2 hours and 20 min, the two summits are pretty enough, but they are kind of nestled amongst other mountains and so unlike Mt Kintoki for instance, there&rsquo;s no spectacular view. There are no toilets or anything else either, just a couple of picnic tables. There were number of wasps flying when I visited, so I didn&rsquo;t linger, just scarfing down a rice ball and some sports drink, and moving along.</p>
<p>The hike up is like other trails in the area, well maintained hard pack dirt with a lot of roots, and some rocks ranging in size from about a baseball to larger boulders. The unique feature of this trail was &ldquo;paving stones&rdquo; sections which you can see in one of the photos I snapped. I read a Japanese review of this trail, and the person said the stones are mossy and slippery when wet. They were dry for me, but I could see this being a pretty precarious trail in the rain. The trail is definitely not as rocky as Mt. Kintoki, and there are no areas with chains or ropes needed, but it&rsquo;s a longer ascent of about 850m, compared to the 600m I did when I went up Mt. Kintoki, so you&rsquo;re feeling it by the time you summit.</p>
<p>On critters, there are signs warning about bears, and though I haven&rsquo;t seen a bear in this area, the sign says if you do, stay calm, don&rsquo;t run or turn your back on them, and just leave the area where the bear is. It&rsquo;s not yet wasp season, which is later summer to early fall, but there were a number of wasps flying. Last week on Mt Kintoki, I was serenaded by cicadas, but on this hike, it was bird song punctuated by occasional angry wasp sounds. With wasps, you must avoid black clothing and perfume, and if you encounter any, just stay calm and get out of there, avoiding trying to swat at them.</p>
<p>Especially around the summits of Sengen and Takanosu, the trail is really pleasant with grasses along the way, and I can imagine this hike is especially lovely in November. I could see momiji and sakura trees, so depending on the time of year, it&rsquo;s got to be breathtaking. I can imagine that allergy season would be a challenge though, with all the cedar trees!</p>
<p>While descending I was feeling like I should have gone for a hike with a better view, but, when I got to Chisuji falls, it was all worth it. What a beautiful place, and my photos don&rsquo;t do it justice. As you approach, you can hear the river and falls, and the trail bottoms out at a bridge, which when crossed is right there at the falls. A friendly older lady hiker was there when I got there, and she rinsed her face in the pool of water at the falls, so I did the same. It was ice cold, and perfect after that long hike. The falls are close to the road, and so are accessible to families with kids. A couple and there young child came up the road to take a look just as I was leaving.</p>
<p>From the falls, it quickly turns to concrete roads as you go down to Kowakidani station, then on to Gora. It was a super hot day, so I got a cold drink at a vending machine, and had a quick toilet break at the toilet near the combini (marked on the Google map). At Gora, I had a cold strawberry dessert to cool down, then took the train down to Tonosawa. From there, I walked to <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and drove back home.</p>

			 <p>On Saturday 22 July 2023, I challenged a solo day hike up Mt Kintoki (金時山 きんときさん) in Hakone, on a perfect day for hiking, and was rewarded with incredible views from the summit. This mountain has maybe the best view of Mt Fuji, too. It was a good physical challenge for this 57 yr old who mostly jogs and walks the dog. My legs held up better this time compared to my <a href="https://blog.cogley.jp/44839/mt-kurobi-first-real-mountain-trek-experience">first adventure up Mt Kurobi in Gunma</a>, probably because I&rsquo;ve tried to be more active since then, doing several less-challenging hikes in the meantime.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mt Kintoki at 1,213m is another &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; mountain, and the 6.2km route I slowly hiked over about 5 hours with breaks, had an elevation change of +-620m , but unlike Mt Kurobi, it gets steep near the top, with some areas having ropes or chains like an easy graded &ldquo;via ferrata&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t feel panic in any areas, but there were a few spots where you could get seriously injured if you fell. I helped a fellow middle aged guy get up after he slipped coming down. He was fine, but he and his climbing partner both looked exhausted, and it made me nervous.</p>
<p>The mountain&rsquo;s formal name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ashigara">Mt Ashigara</a> (足柄山 あしがらさん), but most people call it Mt Kintoki, from the legendary warrior Kintoki Sakata, aka &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintar%C5%8D">Kintaro</a>&rdquo; (金太郎 きんたろう) who grew up on the mountain. Part-way up from the shrine trailhead, you can see a massive boulder that is said to have been split by Kintaro with his axe (now that&rsquo;s bad-ass). There&rsquo;s also an axe prop at the summit, so you can make like the folk hero. Additionally, as this is one of the most climbed mountains in Japan, the routes are well-maintained, and there are bio toilets (100 yen to use) and tea shops serving light food and drink and selling souvenirs at the summit. Read more in English <a href="https://hakone-japan.com/discover/national-park/activities/recommended-hiking-trails/mt-kintoki-course/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/fuji-hakone-izu/see-and-do/mount-kintoki-hiking-trail/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The trail is well maintained indeed, but note that it&rsquo;s rather rocky in many parts. I did this hike in &ldquo;trail shoes&rdquo;, but I could feel my feet getting a little bruised up here and there. I probably would have worn my hiking boots if I were going after a rainy period. The trail is hard pack dirt with a lot of roots, and rocks ranging in size from about a baseball to larger boulders. You ascend stepping on or between the large rocks, onto placed logs, or using tree roots as steps, helping yourself up with the occasional fixed rope or chain. There were some areas with big piles of smaller baseball-sized rocks, which looked to just be there to try to have a more &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; trail with fewer slip hazards. The rocks themselves appear to be either granite or volcanic &ldquo;pumice&rdquo;-like rock.</p>
<p>I started at the Shrine trail head, and looking at the signs for Mt Kintoki there, it gave a time of 75 min to the summit, but someone had cheekily scrawled a &ldquo;90&rdquo; with a paint pen. I imagine the people who maintain the trails and are involved in the sign-making, are more experience hikers than the rest of us schlubs. It took me about 90 min up to the summit, where the view was just fantastic. You can use the toilet for 100 yen, or get a light meal at one of the two Chaya (茶屋). I got shaved ice with stewed sweet beans with (I think) condensed milk, saving the rice ball I&rsquo;d bought for later. The guys who were working in the Chaya were friendly and spoke some English. An old regular came in, plopped down his two bamboo sticks he was using as hiking poles, and started helping the fellows behind the counter. They asked me to sign their English guestbook so I did, but I imagine nobody can read my chicken scratches.</p>
<p>After about 30 min rest, it took another 60 min to get to Mt. Nagao (長尾山 ながおさん) a smaller peak on the way down, then 30 min to Otome Pass (乙女峠 おとめとうげ) where I had another brief rest and ate, then a final 70 min to Otome Trailhead (乙女口 おとめぐち) where I exited onto route 138. While there are indeed bus stops near there, the Sengoku bus stop with frequent service back to Hakone Yumoto, is a couple km down the road.</p>
<p>On access in general, there are a few ways to get there, even a bus out of Shinjuku that goes directly down to the Hakone area. Because I live relatively close to the area, I took JR down to Odawara, then got the T-line Tougendai Bus (T桃源台線バス とうげんだいばす) from outside Odawara station, which goes up the mountain via Hakone Yumoto. It&rsquo;s a ~40min trip up winding roads to the Sengoku Bus Stop (仙石 せんごく), and then a 1km walk from there to the trailhead at Kintoki Shrine. There&rsquo;s a convenience store between the bus stop and the trailhead as well, so you can buy energy gels or protein bars etc. Note you can take the funicular train from Odawara, but you&rsquo;d have to transfer to the same bus anyway at Hakone Yumoto, so it&rsquo;s easiest to get on at Odawara. Coming back, though, I got on the bus at Sengoku and got off part-way down at Kami-Tonosawa, then walked from there to <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and went back up on JR.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s assuredly &ldquo;touristy&rdquo;, a bit like Mt Takao, Kintoki&rsquo;s climbable even in winter without too much trouble. Anytime you&rsquo;re in the mountains, however touristy it may seem, you still need to be prepared. I always bring a small emergency kit, extra clothes and rain gear, and enough food. It might be an exaggeration but &ldquo;better safe than sorry&rdquo;, right? At any rate, if you&rsquo;re interested, you can see the route I hiked, from my <a href="https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5741990.html">Yamareco activity URL</a> map. Hope to see you on the trail some time! 🌋</p>

			 <p>On Saturday 15th July 2023, I did <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1u2i9zEDkFjf1xa7J4e_7blMn3xZt7Y4&amp;usp=sharing">this solo hike and jog</a> from JR Zushi to JR Kita-Kamakura, via the &ldquo;Nagoe Kiridoshi&rdquo; (名越 &ldquo;Nagoe&rdquo; place name 切 &ldquo;Kiri&rdquo; cut 通 &ldquo;Doushi&rdquo; route or way), one of the seven ancient passes cut into the mountains surrounding Kamakura to make it easier for people and horses to pass.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The news said the heat was going to be brutal, so, wanting to be out early, I packed the evening before buying some energy and protein bars at the local supermarket, and was up at 4:30am to get a quick shower and apply sunscreen and insect repellent. It was supposed to be very hot that day, and remembering how waterlogged I was the last hike in trousers and seeing some trail runners in shorts, I opted for running shorts and extra bug spray. On my way by 5:30am, I rode the scooter to, and parked at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Z6g8WEd2t8K4D7FN6">a 24 hour lot at JR Ofuna</a>. From there, I took the JR train two stops south to Zushi and went out the north exit.</p>
<p>After firing up Geographica and Apple Watch Fitness (Hiking), I started jogging at around 6:30am, and it was overcast but already high humidity. Until you get to the Nagoe Kiridoshi trailhead, it&rsquo;s just normal concrete roads, so I decided to take a peek at a recommended temple, Gandenji, which was beautiful and very quiet. There were some cool-looking stone stairs going up past the temple, but we&rsquo;ll leave those for another day. I turned back down the path, jogged back to the main route 311 again, and went up toward where the trailhead for the Nagoe Kiridoushi should be.</p>
<p>Google Maps Directions said I had to go through the famous &ldquo;ghost spot&rdquo; Kotsubo tunnel to get to the stairs that lead up to the trailhead so through I went. I&rsquo;m happy to report I did not see any ghosts, feel any odd cool breezes, or hear any sudden buddhist chanting or jingly bell sounds or anything like that, go figure! Once through the tunnel, the stairs are up around the bend to the left. You schlep up <em>quite</em> a lot of stairs, up and around, and after going through a neighborhood at the top, there&rsquo;s the trailhead at the edge. The sign says you can access the Nagoe Kiridoushi from here.</p>
<p>The trail itself is typical of the &ldquo;Kamakura Alps&rdquo; area, hardpack with roots and rocks, and in the case of these trails, pretty overgrown with lots of fallen trees to clamber under or over. There are signs here and there warning about snakes, so you want to keep an eye peeled, although I did not see any. It was not muddy, I assume due to the recent heat. Trail runner shoes are fine for this trail. If you don&rsquo;t like bugs, bring poles to wave at the plants that you&rsquo;re going to be brushing against. I&rsquo;d also say this trail is dog friendly, except it might be a challenge with the fallen trees, and I&rsquo;d wait until the fall months to bring along Taro.</p>
<p>Once on the trail, there were some explanatory signs for the Nagoe Kiridoshi saying it and others were the primary route for people going up Sagami bay to Kamakura, until the JR Yokosuka line was built. It&rsquo;s just stunning to think of how much work it would have been to physically cut a pass in a mountain like that. Really impressive.</p>
<p>The Mandarado Yagura tombs were closed, so I did not get to see those, but I did pass through another impressive area, the Osarubatake Quarry. It was mistakenly thought this might have been a defense structure for Kamakura, but excavation and research in Heisei showed it was a quarry for stones used in works around Kamakura. It&rsquo;s 800m long and about 5 to 10m high, and leaves a lasting impression.</p>
<p>A bit farther on, there&rsquo;s a small sign that just said &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; so I took off up a side trail, to the top of a peak, from where you could see the beach near Kamakura, and Enoshima island in the distance. It was windy and chilly up there, a relief because the clouds had cleared by then and it was starting to get hot.</p>
<p>From the panoramic view, it was down into the Zushi Highland neighborhood area (there&rsquo;s a toilet at the trailhead), then right back up onto the Heisei Pilgrimage Road trail. It&rsquo;s a lot of up and down, and the trail was pretty overgrown, with a lot of fallen trees here and there along the way. You exit the trail and go down the street, where you run into the &ldquo;Dengakuzushi no michi&rdquo; road near the Nameri river. I went west from there on regular streets, to Tsurugaoka Hachimangu, the major shrine in Kamakura, then north to Kita Kamakura and back to Ofuna by train.</p>
<p>All in all, about 10km, and a historically interesting jog and hike. In cooler weather, there are many more side trips you could do such as visiting Kenchoji. I guess the bug spray worked, too! Hope to see you on the trail! 🥾</p>
