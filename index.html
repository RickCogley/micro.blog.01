			 <p>Japan’s &ldquo;Privacy Mark&rdquo; system had a serious security breach in Aug 2023, and its operator JIPDEC (Japan Information Technology and Social Promotion Association) <a href="https://www.jipdec.or.jp/news/pressrelease/20231113.html">announced the results of an investigation</a> into the matter. 🕵🏻‍♂️</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When companies implement P-Mark, there are a number of requirements to be met, similar to what organizations go through when trying for an ISO certification. Reviewers for JIPDEC are responsible for auditing the certification applications, and one such reviewer had saved review documents on an unsecured personal NAS. A P-Mark holder contacted JIPDEC saying review documents were visible on the internet. That had to sting.</p>
<p>The subsequent investigation showed that leaked information included review documents for applicants, emails and addresses variously of staff, applicants and certification holder companies.</p>
<p>It’s obviously a grave situation for a standards organization to be caught with their proverbial pants down like this, but to JIPDEC’s credit they are showing how seriously they are taking it by banning reviewers from using personal devices for performing reviews. At least it’s a step in the right direction.</p>
<p><em>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</em> In the case of JIPDEC, I guess their customers do. I wish them well while they, um, re-apply for their own P-Mark cert. 😅</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.indexnow.org/documentation">IndexNow</a>&rdquo; is an automatic way to get participating search engines to come search specified URLs your site, and one cool thing about it is if you submit an URL to one, it gets pushed to all. I wanted an easy and automatic way to submit if there are any new URLs on this blog, so I started thinking of a way it could be done. Let me share that with you. 🤓</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A json feed <code>https://cogley.jp/feed.json</code> with post dates and URLs</li>
<li>A <a href="https://webhook.site">webhook.site</a> subscription that lets me schedule custom scripts that can handle json</li>
</ul>
<p>… so I should be able to parse my json, and ping indexnow for any URLs added in the last day, so that if I schedule a daily script run, it will submit just those.</p>
<p>To get set up I followed the steps over on Bing’s <a href="https://www.bing.com/indexnow">indexnow page</a>. First you need to create a file on your site. In micro.blog I edited my custom theme, and added a new template under <code>static</code>. If the API key is <code>47e6f02ccea743bf</code> , then you create a file called <code>47e6f02ccea743bf.txt</code>, and add <code>47e6f02ccea743bf</code> to the body of the file.</p>
<p>The existence of this file serves as proof you own the site, and once published, should be available at:</p>
<pre><code>https://mysite.com/47e6f02ccea743bf.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Now when you have a new or updated URL, you can ping by accessing this API:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.bing.com/indexnow?url=https://mysite.com/path/to/newpost.html&amp;key=47e6f02ccea743bf
</code></pre>
<p>As for automation, I tried various things, but in the end got help from Simon, the owner of <code>webhook.site</code>. You can set up a script there, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">interval</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">86400</span>) {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>} 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">request</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;https://pingomatic.com/ping/?title=My+Blog&amp;blogurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmysite.com&amp;rssurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmysite.com%2Ffeed.xml&amp;chk_blogs=on&amp;chk_feedburner=on&amp;chk_tailrank=on&amp;chk_superfeedr=on&#39;</span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>your <code>feed.json</code> is structured like <a href="https://cogley.jp/feed.json">mine</a></li>
<li>you registered the api key file so indexnow can find it</li>
<li>you also want to ping &ldquo;ping-o-matic&rdquo; about the presence of changes</li>
</ul>
<p>What the script does is, loops through the &ldquo;items&rdquo; node checking all the &ldquo;date published&rdquo; values against the difference between now and that date, and if the interval is less than 86400 (seconds in a day), then it will hit the indexnow API with those URLs. As a last step, it pushes the rss feed to ping-o-matic.</p>
<p>Once it’s working, to trigger it you can schedule it, or, just bookmark and periodically access your webhook.site url, which will look something like: <code>https://webhook.site/#!/a9f864e4-3506-4a13-943d-c5696e9e1eb8</code>. I scheduled mine because I’m updating every day, but if I wasn’t, I’d just bookmark the webhook.site URL and hit that any time I made a new post.</p>
<p>Manton got &ldquo;lastmod&rdquo; working on micro.blog posts, so I can now update my json feed to include the modified timestamp, and check also for recently modified posts. I’ll do that and report back.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to do the same thing, from shell scripts to iOS shortcuts, probably. Perhaps Google will even participate in this system one day.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>20231108</strong> - Ok, after observing the script for a couple days, it is indeed picking up the new posts as expected, so the schedule and script is working as expected. Updated the wording to make it clear that the script is searching for new posts, not modified ones.</li>
<li><strong>20231109</strong> - Mentioned that modified date is now working so that can be added and tested.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Perhaps ten years ago I bought BeyerDynamic T90 headphones, which I love and which have served me well <em>every single day</em>, but they are just falling apart from wear<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, so I was looking for an appropriate replacement. I found new &lsquo;phones from <a href="https://ashidavox.com/">AshidaVox</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> with great cost performance that I’ll share in this review from my perspective as an audio layperson. 🎧</p>

<h3 id="background-and-decision-making">Background and Decision-making</h3>
<p>I’m attracted to wireless headphones and IEMs that connect via Bluetooth, but I have not had good luck with reliability so far, with AirPods or wireless IEM’s of any flavor, so I thought I would look for something good which is also a <em>wired</em> model, for listening to music, podcasts and watching Netflix etc around the home. Maybe I&rsquo;m just old, but it’s less annoying to not have to recharge anyway.</p>
<p>I prefer to support the local economy if I can, because I live and work in Japan, so for this purchase I decided to try to find made-in-Japan headphones, and go with a wired model. Researching here and there <em>e.g.</em> on the <a href="https://e-earphone.jp/">e-earphone</a> site, I learned about <a href="https://tagostudio.com/headphones/">Tago Studio</a> and <a href="https://ashidavox.com/">AshidaVox</a>; two domestic makers of headphones. Tago is recently well regarded overseas, while AshidaVox is well known for its famous ST-31 model especially<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I’m no expert, but the models from Tago Studio, aside from being more expensive than AshidaVox, are apparently tuned for work in a music studio by pros who work in a music studio. I gather that you want separate headphones for that kind of work, as opposed to simply listening to music for pleasure. The higher end Tago’s were raved about on English-speaking sites, for example, and they cost about JPY 65,000. This isn’t that expensive in headphone land, where some really high end headphones sell for 300 to 600K, but it’s 3x the price of the AshidaVox.</p>

<p>Paraphrasing their <a href="https://www.ashida.co.jp/en/company/index.html">website</a>, Ashida Onkyo (&ldquo;Sound&rdquo;) was founded in 1924 (Taisho 13) from the original Ashida Company, the general agent of Magnavox for the Far East region, and switched from importing speakers from the US to producing them domestically, when US-Japan relations deteriorated in 1942. The brand &ldquo;AshidaVox&rdquo; has been in use from 1925 until today, representing quality audio speakers and headphones, for almost 100 years!</p>
<h3 id="deciding-on-the-ashidavox-st-31-02">Deciding on the AshidaVox ST-31-02</h3>
<p>The <strong>AshidaVox ST-31-02</strong> model that I ended up getting, was released on 1st Oct 2023, and cost about JPY 22,000 before tax (with ST-31-02 replacement ear pads available for JPY 2,090). They made <em>only 200 units</em> to start. I read some reports before my purchase that they were great cost-performance, tuned to sound good with various types of music, and despite being &ldquo;closed back&rdquo; type, they have a good &ldquo;sound stage&rdquo;, so, that sounded good enough for me given the low price.</p>
<p>E-earphone’s <a href="https://e-earphone.blog/?p=1477396">blog</a> states (as does AshidaVox’s product release blurb) that the ST-31-02 is the second generation of the famous ST-31 used in many recording studios in the &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s. Paraphrasing, they explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The speaker cone paper that was the heart of the sound was no longer made, so the original model eventually went out of production. However due to a passionate user base, AshidaVox re-released this updated version for general music appreciation purposes. They developed a special Φ 50 mm speaker driver, and while keeping the original flavor of the ST-31, they made the bass deeper and the highs more comfortable, while controlling some unpleasant resonances, giving the product a clear sound signature without muddiness. They are made one by one in Japan with a craftsman’s dexterity and sincerity, without affect, and to a consistently high level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BeyerDynamic T90 headphones I have been using are &ldquo;open back&rdquo; which means they leak sound and might not be appropriate for night use at home or any public use, but, a lot of people like the &ldquo;open&rdquo; design, because it sounds bigger or more airy. The AshidaVox ST-31-02 model is closed, so there is a lot less sound leakage which is probably better for my living situation. If I can get my T90’s repaired I’ll compare.</p>
<p>One criticism I read about the ST-31-02 is that the cord is short, at 1.5m, but, for my usage this is just right. The shortness is a plus for me. The T90 has a 3m cord and it gets tangled up into a weighty mass of excess cable. If I add a USB DAC in-line for a little boost, that adds just a bit of length as well.</p>
<p>In addition, the ST-31-02’s low impedance of <code>26Ω</code> means I can drive them directly from an iPhone or iPad. In comparison, the T90s have an impedance of <code>250Ω</code>, meaning you really need to put them through an amp so they will sound good.</p>
<p>All that said, I decided on the ST-31-02’s because they fit my usage and come from a reputable maker, and in my opinion, they sound great!</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>The purpose of these headphones is to use them around the house for listening to relaxing music during work, or listening to podcasts or lectures, and watching some streaming service videos before bed. I’m certainly not so knowledgeable about audio, and just want headphones to sound &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, so I experimented with some settings for my usage pattern.</p>
<p>If you are interested in testing for yourself, you can copy the settings I made in iPhone and iPad iOS 17.1:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settings, Music, Audio section</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dolby Atmos</strong> - always on<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Lossless</strong> - on for Wi-Fi streaming</li>
<li><strong>EQ</strong> - various, change to suit the music</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the above settings, I tried the ST-31-02’s with and without an amp and they sounded good either way.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Changing the above mentioned EQ setting really helps as well.</p>
<p>The look and feel is quality, but has a sort of retro feel. If &ldquo;modern&rdquo; is slick CNC’ed smoothness, then these look more like a craftsman made them, and maybe they are just a touch old fashioned. The cups look like painted fiberglass, and you get the feeling they would be right at home in a factory or a school. Personally I’m kind of &ldquo;Showa&rdquo; anyway, and I really like it. They feel solid in the hands and snug when worn.</p>
<h3 id="specifications">Specifications</h3>
<p>Here’s the maker specs, translation mistakes mine:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By comparison the T90 headphones have an impedance of <code>250Ω</code> meaning they work better with an amp, a sensitivity of <code>102 dB</code>, and a frequency response of <code>5-40,000 Hz</code>.</p>
<p>So far I really like these AshidaVox headphones and am satisfied about the purchase. I’ll update after I use them for a month or two.</p>
<p>Happy listening! 🎧</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>20231103</strong> - Corrected that AshidaVox is not known overseas; they are. Edited for better flow and added some sections to break up the wall of text. Tried the headphones for a couple hours last night listening to various genres and EQ settings, and I still like them. They were not tiring to use and the &ldquo;snug&rdquo; fit I mentioned wasn’t a problem for me.</li>
<li><strong>20231104</strong> - I had AshidaVox incorrectly written as &ldquo;AudioVox&rdquo; in a few places (d’oh!), fixed. Added other names for the AshidaVox company.</li>
<li><strong>20231107</strong> - Added a little AshidaVox history - they’re almost 100 years old!</li>

			 <p>On Saturday 28 Oct 2023, my daughter K and I drove out to Yamanashi prefecture, for a ~10km hike at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Daibosatsu">Mt. Daibosatsu</a> (&ldquo;Daibosatsurei&rdquo; 大菩薩嶺 2057m). The hike took about 6 hours, with about 650m of ascent and descent from parking 4 down by the lake. A fantastic day, and the 6 hours of driving was well worth it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-5204.jpg" alt="Summit of Daibosatsurei "></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="daibosatsurei-background">Daibosatsurei Background</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Daibosaturei&rdquo; is one of the &ldquo;100 Mountains of Japan&rdquo; (after Kyuya Fukada’s book), located in Yamanashi Prefecture in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichibu_Tama_Kai_National_Park">Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park</a> (in the &ldquo;Kai&rdquo; part), straddling Koshu City and Kitatsurugun, and feeding the Tama and Fuefuki rivers. Here, hiking season is May, and Oct/Nov.</p>
<p>People learned the origin of the mountain’s name from the Records of Kai Province (&ldquo;Kai Koku Shi&rdquo; 甲斐国志), where it’s written that Minamoto No Yoshimitsu got lost on the mountain, and a wood cutter led him to safety, but suddenly vanished<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Yoshimitsu is said to have prayed to the Bodhisatva (Daibosatsu) Hachiman <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to give thanks for saving his life.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>We left Yokohama just before 5am in the dark, but the two hour drive according to Google Maps took three, and when we arrived around 8am, parking lots 1, 2, and 3 were full, and we were directed to lot 4 down by the lake. Fortunately there was a &ldquo;porta-potty&rdquo; style toilet in the lot, so we used that and headed up road and trail to get to the trail head proper.</p>
<p>The hike started in quite an idyllic fashion, walking on a groomed trail with a gentle slope, over wooden deck structures through a lovely forest with bird song and the &ldquo;waka waka&rdquo; call of squirrels. We noticed our cell signals were quite weak here, and could not start our Yamap apps to record at first. It eventually worked as we walked along.</p>
<p>In fifteen minutes or so, we arrived at Lodge Chobei<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> (<a href="http://www.choubei.info/">ロッジ長兵衛</a>), where the parking lot we’d wanted to use was. Here, we bought Daibosatsurei badges for our collection, and proceeded on our way, but they have food and other souvenirs as well. There’s also a public toilet nearby, which I marked on my <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1MVXMB1gmaA-UywbQtQVnfh7Gnc5pZ4w&amp;usp=sharing">annotated map</a>.</p>
<p>The trailhead is &ldquo;Kami-hikawa Touge&rdquo; (上日川峠), &ldquo;touge&rdquo; being mountain pass. This is the name used for the first part of the north-east-bound route up Daibosatsurei, for three (free) parking lots nearby, for the bus stop, and for the dam down near where we parked. Triers should note, the trail head is about 19 or 20km from Chuo Expressway Katsunuma IC by car on a narrow winding road, or by the number 14 bus bound for Kamihikawa Touge, from JR Chuo Kai-Yamato station. It’s an hour whether you’re driving or taking the bus.</p>
<p>From the trailhead, it’s not far to &ldquo;Fukuchan-sou&rdquo; (副ちゃん荘, where &ldquo;sou&rdquo; indicates lodging), and the hike is similar to the first part - easy going, on packed dirt with leaves, pine needles, and some roots. Fukuchan-sou also has food and souvenirs, and a plaque on the outside of the facility states that the (at that time in 2002) Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako rested here during their hike up to Daibosatsurei. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Kyuya Fukada’s &ldquo;100 mountains&rdquo; book gained popularity because the (now) Emperor mentioned enjoying it.</p>
<h3 id="our-route-up-karamatsu-ridge">Our Route Up: Karamatsu Ridge</h3>
<p>Fukuchan-sou marks what’s called the &ldquo;Karamatsu-one&rdquo; (唐松尾根, where &ldquo;one&rdquo; is ridge) Junction, where there’s a public toilet, and where you can elect to go up to the summit clock-wise via Karamatsu Ridge or counter-clockwise via Daibosatsu Pass. After a brief rest and use of the facilities, we turned left here and went up Karamatsu Ridge, because the views are probably better that way and you tax your legs on the steeper part, while they are fresh, and have a more gentle descent.</p>
<p>One thing we noticed is, from right around Fukuchan-sou, the trail gradually turns gravelly, then it changes to a bed of small rocks, which continues pretty much the whole way. I saw a couple people wearing regular sneakers, but you’re going to end up with pretty bruised feet if you do that. Proper hiking boots are recommended on this hike.</p>
<p>The Karamatsu ridge route gets steeper as you go along, and there were a couple spots where I needed to use my hands for stability as I clambered up, and some areas that were simply just crowded with people in what felt like a queue, but there was nothing that was overly risky. A couple people even brought their dogs (even a French bulldog in a halloween costume).</p>
<h3 id="lunch-at-lightning-rock--daibosatsurei-summit">Lunch at Lightning Rock &amp; Daibosatsurei Summit</h3>
<p>Eventually you get to what <em>looks</em> like the summit, but it’s actually the &ldquo;Rai-iwa&rdquo; (雷岩 lightning rock). This is where we stopped for lunch.</p>
<p>Due to the crowds, there weren’t really any smooth rocks to sit on, so we got our sit pads out (recommended!) and made do, boiling some water for instant soup. Rice balls and soup were quaffed while we took in the gorgeous view, and did some people watching, listening to the various languages of the tourist hikers.</p>
<p>From the Rai-iwa, it’s a short jaunt to the summit, where the views are definitely not so great, kind of obscured by trees. A fellow trekker offered to take our photo by the summit marker, so we took him up on that. Now we earned the badges we bought at the foot of the mountain. Back at Rai-iwa, we climbed up on top of the rock crag for the wonderful view to the south, paused a few moments, then started our descent via Daibosatsu Touge (大菩薩峠).</p>
<h3 id="the-descent-via-daibosatsu-touge">The Descent via Daibosatsu Touge</h3>
<p>Daibosatsu Touge is a &ldquo;saddle ridge&rdquo; pass extending about 2km south-southeast ward from Daibosaturei, and affords hikers just <em>stunning</em> views of the surrounding area, as well as mountains such as Kurodake, Genjirodake, and of course the famous Fuji. This day, Fuji was under a bit of cloud cover, but we got some fleeting glimpses of her mass. Part way down, the view opens up and you can see all the way to where the pass summit is marked, at Kaizan-sou lodge.</p>
<p>Daibosatsu Touge is the name of an unfinished 41-episode serialized novel by Kaizan Nakazato (中里介山), from whom the Kaizan-sou lodge gets its name. The novel is said to be popular even today, and was published in national papers from 1913 to 1941 <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, telling the story of a murderous swordsman. It was given a dramatization in the eponymous 1966 film, translated as &ldquo;The Sword of Doom&rdquo; in English. Search and you’ll find a few videos on YouTube including an old trailer.</p>
<h3 id="sudden-weather">Sudden Weather</h3>
<p>During our descent, around &ldquo;Kanbe-iwa&rdquo; (神部岩)<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> , K asked &ldquo;did you feel that? It’s starting to rain.&rdquo; It seemed like rain at first, and as it started to come down, it became clear it was hail. Eventually it got strong enough that we decided to layer up in rain gear, and cover our packs. The line of hikers on the trail all paused at once to do the same thing. It was odd, because we could see the sun across the valley, but were right inside this cold weather. Goes to show, you need to be ready for anything in the mountains.</p>
<p>Just before we got to Daibosatsu Touge, the weather was already clearing up and people were coming out of an emergency shelter. Probably there was no need for it today, but it is nice to know it’s there if you need it. The name is a little disconcerting, &ldquo;Sai-no-kawara&rdquo; (さいの河原), the riverbank in Buddhist canon where Jizo Bodhisatva helps children who died too early avoid evil spirits so they can cross over.</p>
<p>Finally we arrived at the Daibosatsu Touge 1897m elevation marker and Kaizan-sou, where you can have a break, buy some souvenirs, or use the public toilet. There are two ways down from there, one further south to Mt. Kumazawa and back, but we elected to take a hard right before the toilets, to take the shorter easterly route past Fujimi-sou (富士見荘), and back to Fukuchan-sou.</p>
<h3 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h3>
<p>There are some steep areas on the way down, but nothing too hard, and it really gets easier and easier as you get closer to the junction at Fukuchan-sou, with some lovely autumn colors and scenes. From there, it was an easy hike back to the parking lot, where we worried it was going to be impossible to get out, due to how people had randomly parked. We were one of the first cars in lot 4 in the AM, so we were waaay back in the corner of this lot.</p>
<p>We found a day-use onsen called <a href="http://www.daibosatsu-kankou.com/facility/yamato_tenmoku_hotspring.php">Yamato-tenmoku</a>, chucked it in the navi, and it was a welcome rest after our hike. It took 30 or 40 min to drive there, and we had a scrub and a soak<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, a snack, and were on our way home for a big meal. All in all, it was a really lovely day!</p>

			 <p>One funny day: I was out with a client near Motomachi Yokohama, at a warehouse that was a prospect for the client&rsquo;s logistics operations in Japan. The contract was a fairly nice chunk of business, valuing a couple hundred thousand USD per month.</p>
<p>The meeting was a hysterical failure. It was August, super hot and humid as usual for Japan, but the warehouse meeting room <em>had no AC</em> and they insisted we wear construction helmets, and to add insult to injury, would not give us any water. The sweat was rolling off us as we tried to keep from collapsing, while we waited for it to start.</p>
<p>It was typical for meetings of this type in Japan: on the foreigner side there was myself and three C-Level types from the US. On the vendor side, it was something like 20 people. Their team were supposed to present in English, but started in on a presentation in Japanese with no sign of any interpretation. After a few minutes and no sign of English, I reminded them of their promise to present in English, and after a very uncomfortable few minutes and whispered discussion, they tried to corral <em>me</em> into doing it.</p>
<p>My stance was, &ldquo;Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s not happening. I&rsquo;m here on the client&rsquo;s behalf, not yours. You mean to tell me of all 20 of you, nobody actually read the email between your Tanaka san and us over the last month? We were clear on what our requirements were…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long story short, they were unprepared to present in English, and finally dragged a junior marketing person in, who &ldquo;speaks perfect English&rdquo; to do ad hoc interpreting. It was just, comically bad, so much so that I felt like I should assist to try to salvage the meeting, but our team was just wanting to cut it short and go on the tour of the facility. I think their minds were already made up, and we were sweating and parched and wanting to get out of there.</p>
<p>The tour was also bad, because the vendor was insisting on questions in writing during the tour (I mean, what?!), not verbally, and continued to blithely present everything in Japanese. Anyway, the whole thing kind of fizzled once we saw how generally incompetent they were from top to bottom. (The winner of the business by contrast, was really, really good, but, it makes for a less funny story, for sure!)</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s after this disaster ended and we left, that the fun started. There&rsquo;s a beer factory near Motomachi, so two of us went there and did a tour. Had a couple beers on the tour before dinner, then went to dinner had some more. We went to JR Motomachi, and were standing there trying to decide what sort of Strong Zero and snacks to get for the train ride, and this dude saunters up to us.</p>
<p>He looked like one of those movie Yakuza, with full-on white kimono, white shoes, missing digits, deep tan. He was probably in his 50s, about 10 years older than us at the time. He started talking to us in drunk, broken-but-good-enough English: &ldquo;welcome Japan. I buy drink present for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked so scary we were starting to freak out a bit, but he bought us some shochu type drinks and snacks from the Kiosk, gave them to us in a bag and was asking us questions about where we are from and so on.</p>
<p>Then he started to retch, and cough-vomited up a ramen noodle, that lobbed end-over-end until it landed splat on my client&rsquo;s lapel! Thing is, he was so drunk he didn&rsquo;t even really notice, so we just said thanks, stifling disgust and laughter, brushing the vomitus off my friend&rsquo;s lapel, grabbed our shochu&rsquo;s and snacks and retreated into the station through the turnstile.</p>
<p>When I see my client friend, we always recount the &ldquo;flying ramen vomit incident&rdquo; with gestures and SFX. It was an unforgettable experience. 🍜🤢</p>

			 <p><em>German swings</em> scare the bejeezus out of me. Do you know what those are?</p>
<p>When I was a kid in the 1970’s, we used to go to the shore every couple of years, mostly Nags Head, North Carolina. You’d see temporary carnivals here and there, so naturally us kids wanted to ride and we’d beg our parents to let us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;German swings&rdquo; are seats attached to or hung from the outer edge of a large rotating disc by chains. You pull up the bar and sit in the seat, and as the big carousel disc rotates, centrifugal force causes you to swing outward. I have no idea if they came from Germany with the many immigrants to the US, or if it’s some kind of pejorative against Germans, but anyway, we loved them and usually it was a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>One time we were on one, and the operator (a teenager, iirc) left the ride site presumably to use the toilet, but the ride went on and on, and riders were starting to get sick, so parents went to find the operator. When he finally came back, he stopped the ride in a panicked way, kind of jamming on the brakes, and the swings wrapped around the middle of the ride, banging us into the center column once, then unwrapping and banging us again.</p>
<p>Luckily I had the presence of mind to pull my arms in tight because there were definitely injured riders. It was terrifying.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t look at one of those without feeling anxious. 🎡⚠️</p>

			 <p>On Sunday 3 Sept 2023, I did a 6hr solo point-to-point hike in Hakone, ascending 903m up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_My%C5%8Djin_(Kanagawa)">Myojingatake</a> (明神が岳, 1169m) from Daiyuzan <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%80%E4%B9%97%E5%AF%BA">Saijoji Temple</a> (大雄山最乗寺 aka Doryoson), and descending 719m to Miyagino (宮城野) on Rt. 138, traveling over about 9km. From there I took the bus down to Kami-to-no-sawa (上塔ノ沢), then walked to an onsen for a scrub and a soak.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/fa16ac9a-f82b-4d5a-955e-2e3f484b2baf-1724-00000192526852e7.jpg" alt="Photo of Hakone mountains from the top of Mt Myojin"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I <a href="https://cogley.jp/2023/08/19/mt-myojogatake-hiking.html">hiked up Myojogatake</a>, I had intended to go up Myojingatake as well, but I was tired that day and opted out. In looking at various routes up today’s peak, I picked the route coming from the northeast, from the lovely and sprawling temple complex at Saijoji.</p>
<p>As usual, I wanted to start out early to be off the mountain around noon, so I left at 4:30am, got to Odawara before 6:00am, and was at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiy%C5%ABzan_Station">Daiyuzan</a> station, the last stop on the Izu Hakone Tetsudo line, by about 6:20am. To my surprise, the buses up to Saijoji start around 9am, so, I used the public toilet outside the station, then checked the map for how far it would be to walk to Saijoji (about 3km). Fortunately a taxi pulled in, so I took advantage and got a ride up the road. The taxi driver was talkative, regaling me with his own hiking adventures, but we arrived within 15 min.</p>
<p>There’s two more-or-less parallel routes up Myojingatake, both proceeding in the southwest direction from Saijoji. One starts at the Saijoji entrance, off to the left immediately; the other from the back of the complex, after you pass through it. I chose to go through the temple complex and take the more north of the two routes. It was a bit tougher to find the actual trail, but Yamareco kept me on track.</p>
<p>The temple complex is really beautiful, but there are <em>so</em> many steps. I counted about 220 or 230 steps on only the last staircase. There were plenty more before that. After you get on the trail, it’s a cedar forest for most of the way to the top along a ridgeline. The trail is packed dirt with some rocks and roots. It was misty in the early morning, and as I was marveling at the view in one spot, I heard a rustle, and turned to find a doe about 3 meters away. She regarded me, and I regarded her, as I took some snaps and a quick video, then she ran off just as soon as she had come into view. That, and the fog made the hike feel quite magical.</p>
<p>A couple of spots during the ascent are not well marked. I mistakenly headed up a river bed at one, but realized something was off, doubled back, and went up a steeper route to the left which turned out to be right. Another spot was just open forest area where you could barely see the trail. In either case, it helped to look at the <a href="https://www.yamareco.com/">Yamareco</a> app, which has a clear indicator of which direction you should be proceeding, and even lets you know if you veer off.</p>
<p>After the long ascent, I got to what was marked as the summit on the map, but there was no placard or any kind of sign that I was in the right place, so I got a bit worried I was off track. I kept going though, and finally got to a kind of picnic area a few meters below, which had signs and explanations of what should be visible. I didn’t have luck seeing Mt. Fuji again, but I could at least see <a href="https://cogley.jp/2023/07/24/kintoki-hike-in.html">Mt. Kintoki</a> in the foreground (Fuji should have been visible behind it).</p>
<p>I took a short break at the picnic tables, then started descending, eventually merging with the same route as I took when I hiked Myojogatake a few weeks before. As I mentioned in that post, you see signs for the Miyagino Annaijo bus stop and toilet as you get close to the road. I waited a few minutes for a bus bound for Hakone Yumoto, headed down about 15 min or so, then got off at Kami-Tonosawa bus stop. From there I walked a little bit up to <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/" title="Hakone Yuryo">Hakone Yuryo</a>, my oft-frequented day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal.</p>
<p>Hakone Yuryo runs a shuttle bus to and from Hakone Yumoto station, so I took advantage of that to get to Hakone Yumoto afterwards, then took the funicular to Odawara and took the JR train back home.</p>
<p>A couple days after this hike, a retired police and experienced hiker friend told me they used Myojingatake for mountain training when he was in the police academy. He said that a respected older officer suddenly fell dead when they were on a training hike there one day, and that he has never forgotten that incident, burned into his young brain at the time. That was a bit chilling to hear, but it just reminds you that you need to be prepared and ready for anything in the mountains.</p>
<p>As always, please check out the route map on my <a href="https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5897610.html">Yamareco activity URL</a>, and I hope to see you on the trail some time! 🌋</p>

			 <p>On Monday 18 Sept 2023, on Respect-for-the-Aged day, I did a 5hr solo point-to-point hike in Hakone, up the &ldquo;old Tokaido&rdquo; and &ldquo;old Hakone Town&rdquo; roads, ascending 752m and descending 119m over 10.7km. This was not up a single mountain <em>per se</em>, but was plenty tiring going up a very long slope, as the humidity is still hanging around even in September. The hike started in Hakone Yumoto, then followed the road then trails all the way up to Lake Ashi. From there, I got the bus back toward Yumoto, stopping off part way along, to scrub off the trail dirt and have a dip in the onsen.</p>

<p>I got to JR Odawara a bit before 6am and was hiking at Hakone Yumoto by 6:40am, and the first 3 kilometers or so are over road, up route 732. You see Yumoto receding on the right as you ascend. Getting to rt 732 proper required some peering at the map, but once you’re on it, you just have to keep an eye out for some landmarks.</p>
<p>After many bus stops, as you’re nearing the trailhead, you pass a rather colorful temple that reminds one of those in Nikko, the Hakone Dai-tengu, then a hotel on the right, followed by the Sukumogawa IC highway intersection. Another couple hundred meters along, and you’ll see Sagumodera Temple on the left, which has a small waterfall and a water spout for purification next to the road. The Sukumogawa Nature Trail trail head is soon after, also on the left.</p>
<p>At the trail head, you’ll see a sign for the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.hakone-geopark.jp/area-guide/hakone1/006sekisyotoisidatami.html">Hakone Geo-park</a>&rdquo; explaining a bit about the area, and from there, you ascend a bit then basically descend to the river, where you can cross over a narrow wooden footbridge near the Tesco power station. There is also a suspension bridge about 100m upstream, if you’re not comfortable with the &ldquo;maruta-bashi&rdquo;. It was a bit wobbly and unstable, to be honest.</p>
<p>Once you’re over the bridge, you go up to rt 732 again near a shrine, then you’re going to proceed on the Old Tokaido or Old Hakone Town cobblestone roads. The first landmark is the rock that Goro Soga is said to have split with his sword to test its sharpness when seeking revenge, according to the sign. Some sections of the cobble paved roads are actually from the Edo period road started in c. 1603, so walking over those marked sections is a moving experience. Other cobblestone sections were destroyed during the massive &lsquo;quakes in 1923 and 1930, and were repaired after that, using the same road-making techniques.</p>
<p>There are many signs, some with English, that explain how the roads were built. I think that Roman architects would be suitably impressed. I can’t even imagine the amount of labor that building something like these roads would require, back when there was no heavy equipment to rely on. I mean, here I am struggling to just <em>walk</em> on the trail, much less haul large rocks all day. By the way, the cobbles were slippery in parts, so some care was needed. It would be more so, after a rain.</p>
<p>Eventually, as you proceed on and off the old Tokaido road and sometimes rt 732, you’ll get to Hatajuku, one of the old rest stops and so-called <em>ichirizuka</em> distance markers on the old Tokaido; the 23rd &ldquo;ri&rdquo; from Nihonbashi, to be exact.</p>
<p><em>As an aside, the distance markers on the old Tokaido were one &ldquo;ri&rdquo; apart, about 4km. Nihonbashi, where the old Tokaido started, would have therefore been about 92km from Hatajuku. The meter distances on the trail were marked in old style Japanese as bei 米.</em></p>
<p>Hatajuku is full of shops selling the famous Hakone Zaiku wooden <em>yosegi</em> marquetry, and there’s a clean public toilet that you can use before continuing up the trail.</p>
<p>The Tokugawa Shogunate designated 53 official &ldquo;Post Stations&rdquo; where you had to show a travel permit to pass when using the Tokaido. Hatajuku was apparently <em>not</em> one of those, just a rest area, but there are the official Hakone-juku and Odawara-juku nearby. There was also the <a href="https://www.hakonesekisyo.jp/">Hakone Checkpoint</a> that was a security gate, to control who left from or travelled to Edo, and you can visit a museum regarding that in present day near Ashinoko Lake, if you enjoy that history.</p>
<p>From Hatajuku, it’s more ascending up steps and cobblestone paths, and you’ll eventually come to the famous Amazake Chaya where you can take your well-earned break. The strawberry shaved ice with real strawberry chunks was really good, as was the iced matcha, and the atmosphere of the place was just really cool. Compared to the folks who drove there, I was obviously sweating from hiking, and probably didn’t smell that great. They gave me a special &ldquo;safe travels&rdquo; paper that they give to hikers, which I really appreciated. You can see it in the photo below.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes’ break in the Chaya, I completed the ascent, then descended to Ashinoko. I was looking for the Hakone Tozan bus back to Yumoto and one had just arrived, so I didn’t really linger. The bus to Yumoto passes Kami-Tonosawa, where I got off so I could have a soak in the usual <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/" title="Hakone Yuryo">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and took the JR train back home.</p>
<p>So, all in all I walked about 2.7 &ldquo;ri&rdquo; this day, which would have meant I passed by just two of the 128 &ldquo;ri&rdquo; distance markers on what was a 514km cobblestone road, with its 53 official overnight stations like &ldquo;Totsuka-juku&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hakone-juku&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On Sunday 27 August 2023, I challenged myself to an approx 5:45hr 6.8km solo hike in the Tanzawa range on a hot and humid day (it suddenly rained at the end), ascending about 905m up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_%C5%8Cyama_(Kanagawa)">Mt. Oyama</a> starting in the shopping district around 7am, climbing up via the &ldquo;Onna-zaka&rdquo; (women’s slope) route to the summit, then descending about 630m down via Miharashidai to the &ldquo;Shimosha&rdquo; shrine area, and finally down by cable car.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-5241.jpg" alt="Pin badge from Mt. Oyama shop, showing elevation and the name in Japanese and English, depicting a shrine and deer in a forest scene."></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mt. Oyama is considered holy and has significant and interesting history. It’s also known as &ldquo;Afuri Yama&rdquo;, where &ldquo;Afuri&rdquo; refers to the rainy conditions, and &ldquo;Kunimi-yama&rdquo; the Guardian of the Land. The main shrine at the top is called &ldquo;Oyama Afuri Jinja Honsha&rdquo; (大山阿夫利神社 本社), and the one at the base near the top cable car station is &ldquo;Oyama Afuri Jinja Shimosha&rdquo; (大山阿夫利神社 下社), the &ldquo;lower shrine&rdquo;. There is also &ldquo;Oyama Dera&rdquo; a Buddhist Temple at the first stop on the cable car, half way up to the lower shrine.</p>
<p>It may be somewhat crowded and fairly &ldquo;commercialized&rdquo; but Oyama’s a challenging enough intermediate hike nevertheless. If you’re new to mountain trekking, try a smaller peak first, such as Takao or Hakone’s Kintoki, before attempting 1,252m Oyama. Indeed, and true to its &ldquo;Afuri Yama&rdquo; name, this hike was sunny until it suddenly started raining after I got down, but you should be prepared for weather, even in summer. Oyama is located in the Tanzawa-Oyama Quasi National Park in northwest Kanagawa prefecture, with over 38,000 hectares of forest with various mountain hikes, dams, rivers, waterfalls and so on, so if you want more of a challenge, you can try hikes such as To-no-dake and Mt. Tanzawa.</p>
<p>To be more specific, it’s partially about the meters of elevation difference that make a hike easier or harder. Hikes in the Kamakura Alps are over rolling hills, 100 or 200m in height, so you get maybe +/-200 or 300m or so over the course of the hike. When you start actual &ldquo;Tozan&rdquo; (mountain climbing, where the main point is ascending a single or multiple peaks), like at Takao in Tokyo, Kintoki in Hakone, or something like Kurobi in Gunma, you are doing +/-500 or 600m. Then you start doing hikes where you’ve chosen a trail that requires +/-800 to 1000. Tanzawa’s Oyama is one such, as is Hakone’s Sengen or Myojingatake. More difficult are peaks like To-no-dake and Mt. Tanzawa, which are near Oyama but are a 9-10 hour hike over 19km, with +/- 1600m. That’s significantly more difficult. You can have a look at my translation of <a href="https://cogley.jp/japan-mountain-hike-grading/">Japan’s mountain grading system</a>, to see how hikes are graded in Japan and what makes a hike challenging or risky.</p>
<p>So how was the trail? You start the climb by going up many, many stairs through a shopping district (where they sell famous Japanese top souvenirs) at the base of the mountain, stepping and stepping up to the cable car station, which wasn’t operating at 7am anyway. Once you get past the lower cable car station, you have a choice to make, between the feminine and masculine.</p>
<p>Our daughter recommended I take the &ldquo;Onna-zaka&rdquo; (女坂), or &ldquo;women’s slope&rdquo;, up to the lower shrine, because she said &ldquo;Otoko-zaka&rdquo; (男坂), or &ldquo;man’s slope&rdquo; is just too precarious with uneven and crumbling steps. It turns out the &ldquo;Onna-zaka&rdquo; is more interesting anyway, as you can visit Oyama temple which is not accessible from the &ldquo;Otoko-zaka&rdquo;, and, see the &ldquo;nana fushigi&rdquo; or &ldquo;seven curiosities&rdquo; like the childrearing o-Jizo, the relief statue that was carved by a monk using only his fingernails, or the silent bridge (bad luck to talk as you pass over), as well as see some &ldquo;power spots&rdquo; like the &ldquo;married couple cedars&rdquo; or Roben falls.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all culture. There were 山蛭 &ldquo;yamahiru&rdquo; mountain leeches, too. Well, I didn’t actually <em>see</em> any leeches, but there was a sign warning about them, and a tub of salt to use, to coat your socks and shoes with, so coat I did! A mountain-goer friend told me the Oyama area is one of the areas in Tanzawa with money, so they indeed take some measures against mountain leeches, but that other more backcountry destinations in Tanzawa don’t. He recalled he was shocked to find his shins all bloody one hike, from getting some of them on his shins. There’s even a nearby mountain called &ldquo;Mt. Leech&rdquo;, which, sounds like it’s not for the faint-hearted.</p>
<p>I took a break at the beautiful lower shrine, after having ascended the women’s slope. I said a prayer at the shrine, and looked around a little bit. One of many things that stood out was a statue of two school children, looking determined and pointing into what I assume is a bright future, which has an inscription 輝け杉の子 &ldquo;kagayake, Sugi no Ko&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Shine! Children of the Cedars!&rdquo; The sign said it commemorates the 40th anniversary of when about 3000 children evacuated to Oyama during WWII, were returned to their families. Poignant to think that some of these kids had nothing to return to.</p>
<p>From the &ldquo;Shimosha&rdquo; lower shrine, you start up what is now fewer stairs, and more trail, as you ascend to the summit. Recently a friend pointed out that the Tanazawa mountains were formed not by volcanic activity, but by tectonic plates pushing against each other, so the characteristic of the trail is a bit different. It’s not volcanic rock like Mt. Kintoki in Hakone, but more granite-like rocks between the roots and dirt. A little way after the lower shrine, there is a famous geological structure called the Botan Iwa 牡丹岩 or &ldquo;peony rocks&rdquo;, which is a big boulder structure you walk over, with round knobby protrusions between the size of a baseball and a softball, underfoot.</p>
<p>Further along, there were a couple of beautiful views already, where I took a break thinking I would have a protein bar or energy gel. I felt fear set in as I had made a dumb and potentially dangerous mistake. You can access Mt. Oyama via bus from Isehara station on the Odakyu, but I parked in the 2nd lot, just next to the shopping district. And that’s where I left the sports gels and protein bars and rice ball I’d bought for this hike. Luckily, our daughter had given me some 塩分チャージ &ldquo;enbun charge&rdquo; salt candy &ldquo;just in case you get overheated&rdquo; which is a sugar tablet packed with salt and minerals, so I had two of those until I got to the summit. I was humbled and grateful that Oyama is a bit commercialized with a &ldquo;Chaya&rdquo; tea shop at the top. There I bought curry rice and a sports drink, thanking my lucky stars as I ate, that I would not be in danger of bonking on the way down. I did have enough water and sports drink packed with me, but I hope I never forget my food again!</p>
<p>The route down was via &ldquo;Miharashidai&rdquo; which has a great view of Oyama itself and is a nice area to have a picnic, with a lot of picnic benches. There’s many signs on the way down, warning of either risk of slip/fall, or warning of falling rocks. The trail maintainers have affixed large steel cable nets to the mountain, especially where you’re navigating switchback as you descend. You can see that boulders have fallen into the nets, which was a little disconcerting. The app I use, Yamareco, showed a warning marker at one point (users can make a mark and explain why, which is visible on the trail in the app), saying that the trail was difficult to pass. There was a man and woman there that day, cutting trees that had fallen across the trail, using a handsaw. I got the go ahead and scrambled under on my hands and knees. Maybe that warning in the app will now disappear.</p>
<p>Near the end, there’s a pretty waterfall called 二重滝 &ldquo;nijutaki&rdquo; or &ldquo;double falls&rdquo;, near another shrine also with that name. From there, you actually ascend a little again, and you’re back at the lower shrine in no time at all.</p>
<p>Then, it was time to bust out my towel, which I sat on at a café while having a banana smoothie and a sausage. I was tired, so I chickened out of descending the &ldquo;Onna&rdquo; or &ldquo;Otoko&rdquo; slopes again, opting instead to take the cable car down past Oyama Temple, to the base. From there, it was back to the parking lot and back home.</p>

			 <p>The interesting and informative podcast &ldquo;Tell Me Something I Don&rsquo;t Know&rdquo; (TMSIDK) from Stephen Dubner, strikes me as a kind of antidote to &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; so common these days. 📣🎙️</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting format. In their own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell Me Something I Don’t Know is live journalism wrapped in a game-show package and hosted by Stephen J. Dubner, co-author of the Freakonomics books and host of Freakonomics Radio. Stephen has always had a mission: to tell you the things you thought you knew but didn’t; and things you never thought you wanted to know, but do. Now, he has a new way of doing just that. TMSIDK is still journalism, still factual — but disguised in the most entertaining, unexpected, and occasionally ridiculous conversation you’re likely to hear. Guests presenters come on stage before a live audience and try to wow Stephen and his co-host(s) with a fascinating fact, a historical wrinkle, a new line of research — anything, really, as long as it’s interesting, useful and true (or at least true-ish). There’s a real-time human fact-checker on hand to sort fact from fiction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I keep thinking it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;antidote&rdquo; to fake news in a sly way, because of the focus they bring to (admittedly <em>ad hoc</em>) fact checking, because a part of the game is to judge the &ldquo;IDKs&rdquo; participants present as fact, and because of how we get to observe the thought processes of some very smart people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real pleasurable listen, and you might like it too. The show has some serious heavy hitters as panelists. Check it out!</p>

			 <p>My business gets business because Japanese are not so good at English.</p>
<p>With apologies and respect to those Japanese who are fantastic speakers of English, my business <a href="https://esolia.com">eSolia</a> gets business because Japanese speak English poorly. We act as an ombudsman between overseas businesses and their branches based in Japan, and I tell you, it’s a challenge to find Japanese people who can fit our service model of having fluent English and technical skills.</p>
<p>Having watched my kids grow up in the school system here in Japan, there is such a strong focus on memorization, still, that there is just no way they could end up proficient in English.</p>
<p>You have to learn a language like a baby does - through sound and repetition. That&rsquo;s always where to start, not by slogging through soul-crushingly long, eyesight-destroying lists of English vocab. Kids in Japan got vocabulary, but it&rsquo;s all in their head. They mostly can&rsquo;t speak, because they <em>don&rsquo;t</em> speak in class. Their Japanese teachers are no better, with some foisting their awful, embarrassing pronunciation on their classes. I&rsquo;ve seen <em>that</em> nonsense first hand.</p>
<p>There are periodic articles in local English newspapers stating that English proficiency is poor, or scores or down, and so on. The Gov&rsquo;t of Japan has been paying lip service to better learning of English since I came here in 1987 (blergh, getting old here), but I&rsquo;ve seen only modest improvements. It&rsquo;s because of the irrational focus on rote memorization in my opinion.</p>
<p>When I have conference calls, I always wonder why other S.E. Asia countries’ English speakers are doing fine, and why Japan’s mostly aren’t. People from Singapore, Hong Kong, India all have &ldquo;accented&rdquo; English, but speak it fluidly and with confidence, generally.</p>
<p>I myself have an accent I reckon: an American one (or by now, maybe a Japanese one!). <em>Monbusho</em> just never change, do they? I think my business will still have opportunities from now and into the future.</p>

			 <p>On Saturday 12 August 2023, I did an approx 4hr 6.7km solo hike in Hakone on a humid day, ascending about 570m to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_My%C5%8Dj%C5%8D" title="Mt. Myojogatake">Mt. Myojogatake</a> (明星ヶ岳 みょうじょうがたけ 923m) from the Miyaginobashi bus stop, heading towards Mt. Myojingatake past the giant kanji cut into the mountain side for the o-bon festival, then down toward the Miyagino Annaijo bus stop.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mt Myojogatake is one of the stops on the gairin &ldquo;outer rim&rdquo; (外輪 がいりん) of Hakone, and you might meet trail runners attempting to complete that brutal course. If you’re a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; person with decent fitness, you&rsquo;ll find this hike up to Myojogatake just right. No need to attempt to run it! Although summer in Japan brings intense humidity and lots of pestering insects.</p>
<p>From the placard at the summit, you&rsquo;ll read it gets its name &ldquo;Myojo&rdquo; from Venus, the morning or evening star. It&rsquo;s also known as Mt. Kuno, from its vicinity to the Kuno district, and Mt. Daimonji, from the main event at the annual Hakone Gora summer festival held on Aug 16th at the end of o-bon, when a giant 10m wide &ldquo;dai&rdquo; kanji symbol, 大, cut into the side of the mountain, is set alight. After the initial ascent, I got passed by a young fellow carrying a gas-powered weed whacker on his shoulder, then later ran into him and two other older men with various gardening gear, who said they were cleaning up the giant 大 in preparation for the festival. I was glad for my desk job right about then, but also a little jealous of such a cool activity prepping for such an important cultural event.</p>
<p>The summit is pretty enough, with a manicured grassy open area (no toilet), and a small shrine next to the summit placard, but the views are not really spectacular. For that, hike to the next peak over, Mt. Myo-jin-gatake, or a little further on, to Mt. Kintoki. The views from the &ldquo;dai&rdquo; area are nice though, and you can see Gora, the ropeway, and Mt. Hakone and its surroundings quite well. To be honest, I just wanted to do a hike, so I picked this trail and this mountain, then figured out where I was when I got there. It was cool to learn where the giant 大 symbol is physically, see how it&rsquo;s maintained, and read a little about the mountain.</p>
<p>There were no &ldquo;paving stone&rdquo; sections like you see on the Yusaka or &ldquo;Old Kamakura&rdquo; trail from Yumoto up to Mt. Sengen, but otherwise the trail was typical for this area: hard pack dirt with a lot of roots and rocks, mostly larger ones, and some steps made from cut logs. Also, I saw a sign again and finally figured out what it meant. The sign says to scoop up even a handful of dirt from the &ldquo;water channel&rdquo;, and what is meant by that, is there are channels cut across the trail to allow water to pass, which get filled with dirt and silt. They are asking hikers to grab a handful and toss it aside, so I did. You can see the sign and said water channel in the photos.</p>
<p>The descent was uneventful except for one area where it was too much of a drop (for me) to maneuver myself down, so I dropped my poles and pack down onto a flat area, turned around, and somehow lowered myself down. I find fear creeping into my thoughts in these situations, so I know I won&rsquo;t be hiking something like Mt. Tsurugi anytime soon! You&rsquo;ll probably find trekking poles to be useful on the descent.</p>
<p>I was on the trail by 6:45am, and while there was a lot of bird song, which was pleasant, there were also a lot of flying insects this time. Some bees, some hornets, and some large flying insects which were really persistent; they looked like large flies with a white spot on their abdomen. A friend told me about a saying that goes something like &ldquo;the mountains are ours in the mornings but theirs at night.&rdquo; He said he started out on some Hakone trail around noon, and said he felt monkey eyes on him as he descended near dusk. Said it was a creepy experience he doesn&rsquo;t want to repeat. Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ll leave before sunrise in the future too.</p>
<p>As you get to the trail head after descending, you start seeing signs for the bus stop and public toilets. The Miyagino Annaijo bus stop maintains a public restroom, which I used before getting on the bus and heading down to Kami-Tonosawa bus stop. From there I walked a little bit up to <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/" title="Hakone Yuryo">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and took the JR train back home.</p>

A Shinto shrine was built, and it was given the common name &ldquo;Sengen&rdquo; (also pronounced &ldquo;Asama&rdquo;) which you see here and there in Japan. There&rsquo;s one near where I live, a shrine on the highest hill around. When I decided on this hike, I was hoping to see something interesting historically, and while I read that Mt Takanosu is where the ruins of Takanosu castle are located, there&rsquo;s actually nothing there with the sign saying basically &ldquo;the castle was around here, somewhere&rdquo;. This castle is said to have been the Hojo Clan stronghold to protect against Toyotomi Hideyoshi&rsquo;s attack on Odawara in 1590 (Tensho 18), and since the sign at Mt Sengen also says Takanosu Castle was located there, perhaps both mountains were part of the fortifications.</p>
<p>At any rate, after ~7km of ascending over 2 hours and 20 min, the two summits are pretty enough, but they are kind of nestled amongst other mountains and so unlike Mt Kintoki for instance, there&rsquo;s no spectacular view. There are no toilets or anything else either, just a couple of picnic tables. There were number of wasps flying when I visited, so I didn&rsquo;t linger, just scarfing down a rice ball and some sports drink, and moving along.</p>
<p>The hike up is like other trails in the area, well maintained hard pack dirt with a lot of roots, and some rocks ranging in size from about a baseball to larger boulders. The unique feature of this trail was &ldquo;paving stones&rdquo; sections which you can see in one of the photos I snapped. I read a Japanese review of this trail, and the person said the stones are mossy and slippery when wet. They were dry for me, but I could see this being a pretty precarious trail in the rain. The trail is definitely not as rocky as Mt. Kintoki, and there are no areas with chains or ropes needed, but it&rsquo;s a longer ascent of about 850m, compared to the 600m I did when I went up Mt. Kintoki, so you&rsquo;re feeling it by the time you summit.</p>
<p>On critters, there are signs warning about bears, and though I haven&rsquo;t seen a bear in this area, the sign says if you do, stay calm, don&rsquo;t run or turn your back on them, and just leave the area where the bear is. It&rsquo;s not yet wasp season, which is later summer to early fall, but there were a number of wasps flying. Last week on Mt Kintoki, I was serenaded by cicadas, but on this hike, it was bird song punctuated by occasional angry wasp sounds. With wasps, you must avoid black clothing and perfume, and if you encounter any, just stay calm and get out of there, avoiding trying to swat at them.</p>
<p>Especially around the summits of Sengen and Takanosu, the trail is really pleasant with grasses along the way, and I can imagine this hike is especially lovely in November. I could see momiji and sakura trees, so depending on the time of year, it&rsquo;s got to be breathtaking. I can imagine that allergy season would be a challenge though, with all the cedar trees!</p>
<p>While descending I was feeling like I should have gone for a hike with a better view, but, when I got to Chisuji falls, it was all worth it. What a beautiful place, and my photos don&rsquo;t do it justice. As you approach, you can hear the river and falls, and the trail bottoms out at a bridge, which when crossed is right there at the falls. A friendly older lady hiker was there when I got there, and she rinsed her face in the pool of water at the falls, so I did the same. It was ice cold, and perfect after that long hike. The falls are close to the road, and so are accessible to families with kids. A couple and there young child came up the road to take a look just as I was leaving.</p>
<p>From the falls, it quickly turns to concrete roads as you go down to Kowakidani station, then on to Gora. It was a super hot day, so I got a cold drink at a vending machine, and had a quick toilet break at the toilet near the combini (marked on the Google map). At Gora, I had a cold strawberry dessert to cool down, then took the train down to Tonosawa. From there, I walked to <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and drove back home.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On Saturday 22 July 2023, I challenged a solo day hike up Mt Kintoki (金時山 きんときさん) in Hakone, on a perfect day for hiking, and was rewarded with incredible views from the summit. This mountain has maybe the best view of Mt Fuji, too. It was a good physical challenge for this 57 yr old who mostly jogs and walks the dog. My legs held up better this time compared to my <a href="https://blog.cogley.jp/44839/mt-kurobi-first-real-mountain-trek-experience">first adventure up Mt Kurobi in Gunma</a>, probably because I&rsquo;ve tried to be more active since then, doing several less-challenging hikes in the meantime.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mt Kintoki at 1,213m is another &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; mountain, and the 6.2km route I slowly hiked over about 5 hours with breaks, had an elevation change of +-620m , but unlike Mt Kurobi, it gets steep near the top, with some areas having ropes or chains like an easy graded &ldquo;via ferrata&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t feel panic in any areas, but there were a few spots where you could get seriously injured if you fell. I helped a fellow middle aged guy get up after he slipped coming down. He was fine, but he and his climbing partner both looked exhausted, and it made me nervous.</p>
<p>The mountain&rsquo;s formal name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ashigara">Mt Ashigara</a> (足柄山 あしがらさん), but most people call it Mt Kintoki, from the legendary warrior Kintoki Sakata, aka &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintar%C5%8D">Kintaro</a>&rdquo; (金太郎 きんたろう) who grew up on the mountain. Part-way up from the shrine trailhead, you can see a massive boulder that is said to have been split by Kintaro with his axe (now that&rsquo;s bad-ass). There&rsquo;s also an axe prop at the summit, so you can make like the folk hero. Additionally, as this is one of the most climbed mountains in Japan, the routes are well-maintained, and there are bio toilets (100 yen to use) and tea shops serving light food and drink and selling souvenirs at the summit. Read more in English <a href="https://hakone-japan.com/discover/national-park/activities/recommended-hiking-trails/mt-kintoki-course/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/fuji-hakone-izu/see-and-do/mount-kintoki-hiking-trail/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The trail is well maintained indeed, but note that it&rsquo;s rather rocky in many parts. I did this hike in &ldquo;trail shoes&rdquo;, but I could feel my feet getting a little bruised up here and there. I probably would have worn my hiking boots if I were going after a rainy period. The trail is hard pack dirt with a lot of roots, and rocks ranging in size from about a baseball to larger boulders. You ascend stepping on or between the large rocks, onto placed logs, or using tree roots as steps, helping yourself up with the occasional fixed rope or chain. There were some areas with big piles of smaller baseball-sized rocks, which looked to just be there to try to have a more &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; trail with fewer slip hazards. The rocks themselves appear to be either granite or volcanic &ldquo;pumice&rdquo;-like rock.</p>
<p>I started at the Shrine trail head, and looking at the signs for Mt Kintoki there, it gave a time of 75 min to the summit, but someone had cheekily scrawled a &ldquo;90&rdquo; with a paint pen. I imagine the people who maintain the trails and are involved in the sign-making, are more experience hikers than the rest of us schlubs. It took me about 90 min up to the summit, where the view was just fantastic. You can use the toilet for 100 yen, or get a light meal at one of the two Chaya (茶屋). I got shaved ice with stewed sweet beans with (I think) condensed milk, saving the rice ball I&rsquo;d bought for later. The guys who were working in the Chaya were friendly and spoke some English. An old regular came in, plopped down his two bamboo sticks he was using as hiking poles, and started helping the fellows behind the counter. They asked me to sign their English guestbook so I did, but I imagine nobody can read my chicken scratches.</p>
<p>After about 30 min rest, it took another 60 min to get to Mt. Nagao (長尾山 ながおさん) a smaller peak on the way down, then 30 min to Otome Pass (乙女峠 おとめとうげ) where I had another brief rest and ate, then a final 70 min to Otome Trailhead (乙女口 おとめぐち) where I exited onto route 138. While there are indeed bus stops near there, the Sengoku bus stop with frequent service back to Hakone Yumoto, is a couple km down the road.</p>
<p>On access in general, there are a few ways to get there, even a bus out of Shinjuku that goes directly down to the Hakone area. Because I live relatively close to the area, I took JR down to Odawara, then got the T-line Tougendai Bus (T桃源台線バス とうげんだいばす) from outside Odawara station, which goes up the mountain via Hakone Yumoto. It&rsquo;s a ~40min trip up winding roads to the Sengoku Bus Stop (仙石 せんごく), and then a 1km walk from there to the trailhead at Kintoki Shrine. There&rsquo;s a convenience store between the bus stop and the trailhead as well, so you can buy energy gels or protein bars etc. Note you can take the funicular train from Odawara, but you&rsquo;d have to transfer to the same bus anyway at Hakone Yumoto, so it&rsquo;s easiest to get on at Odawara. Coming back, though, I got on the bus at Sengoku and got off part-way down at Kami-Tonosawa, then walked from there to <a href="https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and went back up on JR.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s assuredly &ldquo;touristy&rdquo;, a bit like Mt Takao, Kintoki&rsquo;s climbable even in winter without too much trouble. Anytime you&rsquo;re in the mountains, however touristy it may seem, you still need to be prepared. I always bring a small emergency kit, extra clothes and rain gear, and enough food. It might be an exaggeration but &ldquo;better safe than sorry&rdquo;, right? At any rate, if you&rsquo;re interested, you can see the route I hiked, from my <a href="https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5741990.html">Yamareco activity URL</a> map.

			 <p>On Saturday 15th July 2023, I did <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1u2i9zEDkFjf1xa7J4e_7blMn3xZt7Y4&amp;usp=sharing">this solo hike and jog</a> from JR Zushi to JR Kita-Kamakura, via the &ldquo;Nagoe Kiridoshi&rdquo; (名越 &ldquo;Nagoe&rdquo; place name 切 &ldquo;Kiri&rdquo; cut 通 &ldquo;Doushi&rdquo; route or way), one of the seven ancient passes cut into the mountains surrounding Kamakura to make it easier for people and horses to pass.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The news said the heat was going to be brutal, so, wanting to be out early, I packed the evening before buying some energy and protein bars at the local supermarket, and was up at 4:30am to get a quick shower and apply sunscreen and insect repellent. It was supposed to be very hot that day, and remembering how waterlogged I was the last hike in trousers and seeing some trail runners in shorts, I opted for running shorts and extra bug spray. On my way by 5:30am, I rode the scooter to, and parked at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Z6g8WEd2t8K4D7FN6">a 24 hour lot at JR Ofuna</a>. From there, I took the JR train two stops south to Zushi and went out the north exit.</p>
<p>After firing up Geographica and Apple Watch Fitness (Hiking), I started jogging at around 6:30am, and it was overcast but already high humidity. Until you get to the Nagoe Kiridoshi trailhead, it&rsquo;s just normal concrete roads, so I decided to take a peek at a recommended temple, Gandenji, which was beautiful and very quiet. There were some cool-looking stone stairs going up past the temple, but we&rsquo;ll leave those for another day. I turned back down the path, jogged back to the main route 311 again, and went up toward where the trailhead for the Nagoe Kiridoushi should be.</p>
<p>Google Maps Directions said I had to go through the famous &ldquo;ghost spot&rdquo; Kotsubo tunnel to get to the stairs that lead up to the trailhead so through I went. I&rsquo;m happy to report I did not see any ghosts, feel any odd cool breezes, or hear any sudden buddhist chanting or jingly bell sounds or anything like that, go figure! Once through the tunnel, the stairs are up around the bend to the left. You schlep up <em>quite</em> a lot of stairs, up and around, and after going through a neighborhood at the top, there&rsquo;s the trailhead at the edge. The sign says you can access the Nagoe Kiridoushi from here.</p>
<p>The trail itself is typical of the &ldquo;Kamakura Alps&rdquo; area, hardpack with roots and rocks, and in the case of these trails, pretty overgrown with lots of fallen trees to clamber under or over. There are signs here and there warning about snakes, so you want to keep an eye peeled, although I did not see any. It was not muddy, I assume due to the recent heat. Trail runner shoes are fine for this trail. If you don&rsquo;t like bugs, bring poles to wave at the plants that you&rsquo;re going to be brushing against. I&rsquo;d also say this trail is dog friendly, except it might be a challenge with the fallen trees, and I&rsquo;d wait until the fall months to bring along Taro.</p>
<p>Once on the trail, there were some explanatory signs for the Nagoe Kiridoshi saying it and others were the primary route for people going up Sagami bay to Kamakura, until the JR Yokosuka line was built. It&rsquo;s just stunning to think of how much work it would have been to physically cut a pass in a mountain like that. Really impressive.</p>
<p>The Mandarado Yagura tombs were closed, so I did not get to see those, but I did pass through another impressive area, the Osarubatake Quarry. It was mistakenly thought this might have been a defense structure for Kamakura, but excavation and research in Heisei showed it was a quarry for stones used in works around Kamakura. It&rsquo;s 800m long and about 5 to 10m high, and leaves a lasting impression.</p>
<p>A bit farther on, there&rsquo;s a small sign that just said &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; so I took off up a side trail, to the top of a peak, from where you could see the beach near Kamakura, and Enoshima island in the distance. It was windy and chilly up there, a relief because the clouds had cleared by then and it was starting to get hot.</p>
<p>From the panoramic view, it was down into the Zushi Highland neighborhood area (there&rsquo;s a toilet at the trailhead), then right back up onto the Heisei Pilgrimage Road trail. It&rsquo;s a lot of up and down, and the trail was pretty overgrown, with a lot of fallen trees here and there along the way. You exit the trail and go down the street, where you run into the &ldquo;Dengakuzushi no michi&rdquo; road near the Nameri river. I went west from there on regular streets, to Tsurugaoka Hachimangu, the major shrine in Kamakura, then north to Kita Kamakura and back to Ofuna by train.</p>
<p>All in all, about 10km, and a historically interesting jog and hike. In cooler weather, there are many more side trips you could do such as visiting Kenchoji. I guess the bug spray worked, too! Hope to see you on the trail! 🥾</p>

			 <p>On Sunday 2nd July 2023, I challenged myself with <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1AojU_s53wMsfTyJR4EfE8ODwG5T0Rog&amp;usp=sharing">this ~12km solo hike</a> from JR Kounandai to JR Kamakura, via the Kamakura Ten&rsquo;en Hiking Trail in the &ldquo;Kamakura Alps&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After delivering the pamphets and papers from the chonai meeting the night before to our group&rsquo;s mailboxes, I set out at about 6:30 am on the scooter, and parked at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Z6g8WEd2t8K4D7FN6">a 24 hour lot at JR Ofuna</a>. From there, I took the train two stops up the Negishi line to Kounandai, bought a couple of protein bars at the combini, and exited. Outside the station, I turned on Geographica and Apple Watch Fitness (Hiking), and set off toward the trailhead which is up the hill from that station.</p>
<p>It was already hot by the time I got started, around 30C with high humidity around 90%. The week before I had taken our dog Maru on a shorter hike in these same woods, and got bit by a &ldquo;buyo&rdquo; black fly. Not recommended, would not repeat. This time, thanks to the hive mind on social, I used bug repellent and brought hakka (peppermint) oil to spritz with along the way.</p>
<p>The trailhead wasn&rsquo;t immediately apparent. From Konandai 5 intersection, you turn in before the fire dep&rsquo;t, then take the first left up the steep path that goes behind the recyling center. On Google Maps it kind of looks like you can get to the trail from behind the recyling center, but you can&rsquo;t. The link above shows how you need to go.</p>
<p>At first the trail is just a concrete path, but that slowly changes to trail as you go along up toward the Isshindo plaza. About the trail, it&rsquo;s typical for trails in this area: hardpack dirt with a lot of roots and some rocks, and areas that are just a massive boulder you walk over. So many people have passed over the years, that there are grooves worn into the rock. It had rained the day before, so there was a considerable amount of mud the entire trip, getting worse as I went along. I was glad for long hiking pants, though there were plenty of trail runners in shorts. Today I wore trail running shoes, not boots, and while boots would have been better in the mud, the trail running shoes are much better for this kind of surface in general. I&rsquo;m currently wearing Columbia Montrail&rsquo;s which I like as much as the Altra LonePeaks I had before.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t trail run, but I fast-walked or jogged where I could, from Isshindo, past Enkaizan, Shodo Citizens Forest, Kanazawa Citizens Forest, the Sekiyaoku viewing platform, making it to the Yokohama Nature Observation Forest and Shikai Plaza. Shikai is the border between Yokohama and Kamakura, and from there it&rsquo;s a short 30 min or so to Kamakura Ten&rsquo;en. There&rsquo;s a rest house at Ten&rsquo;en where you can get food like Oden or just sit if you get a drink from the vending machine (it&rsquo;s a private rest house) but this time I did not go there. I went up to Ten&rsquo;en itself, which is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WH5CJH1LFHxbUGgh7">the highest point in Yokohama city</a> and has a nice view (around here, the trail kind of straddles the border between Yokohama and Kamakura).</p>
<p>From Ten&rsquo;en I had to decide whether to press on to Kenchoji near JR Kita-Kamakura or to go down to Zuizenji. The sign said 90 min to Kenchoji so I opted to turn left and go down to Zuizenji instead, a much shorter trip. Though shorter, the descent was a bit gnarly, with a lot of slippery knee-stressing natural steps. By that time it was about 9km in, and I was feeling it. My legs were starting to shake and I had to pause a few times and just take it slow. There&rsquo;s a sign at some point that says it&rsquo;s 400m to Zeizenji, so I&rsquo;m thinking, oh, easy, but no, nature laughs. That&rsquo;s where the descent really started. If you&rsquo;re young or in great shape, it&rsquo;s probably not a problem, but I was glad when that 400m was over!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t visit Zuizenji, but just walked down the hill toward Kamakuragu (toilets there), helping a tourist find parking a long the way. On the way to Kamakura station, there&rsquo;s a German café &ldquo;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wbQKYqvnCxz296b88">Bergfeld</a>&rdquo; which serves an excellent open face sandwich lunch set. Light, and just right after this hike.</p>
<p>From Bergfeld, it was a short trip through incredible crowds to get to JR Kamakura, and then it was two stops back to Ofuna and home by scooter. All in all, a great but exhausting day! Hope to see you on the trail! 🥾</p>

			 <p>On Saturday 3rd June 2023, I had my first real mountain trekking experience. It was fantastic with perfect weather, but I got to discover how out of shape I really am. We went up Mt. Akagi, aka Mt. Kurobi, in Gunma Prefecture; one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Famous_Japanese_Mountains">100 famous mountains of Japan (English)</a> or 百名山 &ldquo;hyakumeisan&rdquo;. During the trek, I asked our guide why Akagi&rsquo;s considered a &ldquo;beginner mountain&rdquo;, and she said it&rsquo;s because there are not many areas where you&rsquo;d risk death. Right. 😰</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have done some trail hiking in Kamakura and the Miura Alps, but our daughter who has been climbing progressively harder mountains, said &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just hiking, not mountain climbing&rdquo;, and encouraged us all to go up an easy mountain together. Not wanting to wuss out in front of my daughters or wife, we booked a guided tour via Club Tourism, and off the four of us went.</p>
<p>Mt. Akagi was apparently formed as a result of a volcanic eruption 10s of thousands of years ago. You take a bus up to the visitor center at Lake Ono, at about 1,300 m, and climb up to the summit at 1,828 m (5,997 ft). You can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Akagi">read about its history on Wikipedia (English)</a> or see Maebashi City&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.city.maebashi.gunma.jp/soshiki/bunkasupotsukanko/kankoseisaku/gyomu/5/1/3688.html">informative (English) page</a> on it.</p>
<p>A typhoon had passed through Yokohama the night before, and we thought surely the tour would get cancelled, but there was no such message as of evening the night before, so we got up around 4am Saturday, and made our way to Yokohama station, then to the Bay Quarter where the bus was going to pick us up at 7am. We got underway exactly on time, because Japan, but there was an accident on the highway, causing us and everyone else to have to reroute, which lost us about 2 hours. We were due to start climbing in the AM and summit at around noon, but we ended up starting up at noon. Fortunately, the weather had broken and it was sunny, if a little chilly, at the visitor area. We had a toilet break, got laced up and did some group stretching to limber up.</p>
<p>From the trail head near the bus stop to the summit, it&rsquo;s a steep uphill climb for ~100 minutes. The terrain is rocky, with a lot of small boulders and rocks between and on which you climb. There are a few lovely views on the way up, where you can see Lake Ono and a smaller sister lake. The route was full of flowering trees, which are a colorful respite from all the rocks.</p>
<p>At first I thought &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only about 500m elevation change, how hard could it be?&rdquo; But, it was <strong>plenty</strong> hard. Especially if you&rsquo;re a middled aged guy like me who mostly does light jogging and walking the dog. I do a lot of that, but this climb was more like doing 1000 squats. Ms. Okubo, our mountain guide, spent years in the Himalayas and was really knowledgable, and just built different physically. It felt much safer climbing up with her there to support us. 🙏🏻</p>
<p>As we climbed it got colder, and on one of the short breaks we added a layer. Once we got to the summit, it was quite cold, maybe about 10C in temp but feeling way colder due to the strong wind. The summit has a sign to go two minutes down the trail to the point where the view is better, and while the view was indeed spectacular, it was freezing. More layers! The summit was the less windy of the two spots, so it was there we scarfed down our onigiri balls and protein bars, then we got on our way after maybe 20 min.</p>
<p>The next stop was Komagatake, a smaller peak on the way back to the visitor center, so you go down a bit then back up. We were there for 10 min, then it was all descent to the visitor center again. The way down is steps - lots and lots of steps, made from wood, rock or steel. I was thinking as I slogged down them how I admired the people who installed those steps. Must have been a really hard and long job to do it. Okubo san said the steel steps are dicey in the rain, so I was just grateful it was dry already.</p>
<p>Partway down my knees and legs were just spent, and I was having a lot of trouble and pain. It was a great experience and one I hope to repeat, but I have to figure out how to better bullet proof my knees!</p>
<p>Regarding the level of difficulty in general, I guess the Japanese word &ldquo;tozan&rdquo; 登山 implies hiking up to the peak of one of the many, many mountains in Japan, and then hiking back down. This qualifies as that, and was different from hiking in, say, the Miura Alps or Kamakura. Indeed, Mt. Akagi / Kurobi is just a trek, albeit a steep one, and there were just a few areas where we were cautioned not to get close to the edge because a fall would mean serious injury or death. But there are certainly no terrifying areas on this hike, and nothing technical like rope work.</p>
<p>At any rate, if you&rsquo;re interested, you can see our route, from my <a href="https://yamap.com/activities/24663529">Yamap activity URL</a> and a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1NMgHhdE0CJhkonToMovU7eEqMyrIa4A&amp;usp=sharing">saved Google Maps</a> map. Maybe we&rsquo;ll see you out there some time! 🌋</p>

			 <p>Someone in my firm setup a trial MS365 account, and our production domain got &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in the test tenant. Removing it so I could register it in the production tenant was <a href="https://blog.cogley.jp/40541/trials-of-ms365-trial-tenant">quite an ordeal</a> so I blogged about it. 😮‍💨</p>

		<a href="https://cogley.jp/2022/11/29/m-trial-tenant.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-29 08:00:00 &#43;0900">Nov 29, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We at my firm eSolia decided to migrate everything to Microsoft M365, for better or worse, because literally all our clients use it and things are just more efficient if it&rsquo;s our daily driver. However, we had used a production domain in a trial tenant in the past, and this caused a lot of agita.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Besides the <code>tenantname.onmicrosoft.com</code> domain that comes with the service, you can assign a <em>custom</em> domain that you purchase via a registrar in the usual way. You add the domain you want in either Exchange or Azure AD admin, add a TXT record in your DNS host (like AWS Route53) to prove that you own the domain, and once that&rsquo;s done, the domain is ready to be put into production when you point the DNS MX records at it.</p>
<p>However, when we clicked &ldquo;verify&rdquo; we got an error, saying that the domain was associated with the tenant <code>ourfirmcojp.onmicrosoft.com</code> and that we&rsquo;d need to remove it from there, before we could add it to our production tenant. From that, support told us that it was probably generated during a self-service trial in which the person signing up used their company email address. They thought so because the tenant name was just our email domain without any dots (<code>ourfirm.co.jp</code>). The test tenant had become an &ldquo;unmanaged tenant&rdquo;, abandoned.</p>
<p>We tried taking advice from a whole bunch of various online help forum and blog posts and support, to &ldquo;force takover&rdquo; the domain, but nothing worked, GUI, powershell or otherwise. Finally we tried using a private browser window to log in via various possible users, and mostly, we just got more errors that self-service password resets SSPR was not enabled.</p>
<p>Except for one account.</p>
<p>We were able to change the password for this account in this tenant, and <em>finally</em> successfully signed in via <code>https://admin.microsoft.com</code>.</p>
<p>Once I was in, I created a global admin user, re-signed in as it, deleted all the other users, groups, and licenses (following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-delete-howto#prepare-the-directory">this guide</a>), then proceeded to delete the tenant. When you first attempt to delete it, there are a lot of various errors but MS makes it easy to figure out what you need to do, deleting groups, disabling licenses and so on. It&rsquo;s a whole process, and in the end once all the checks are &ldquo;green&rdquo;, you need to wait 72 hours before you can finally delete the tenant itself.</p>
<p>So, in 72 hours I&rsquo;ll visit <a href="https://aad.portal.azure.com/">https://aad.portal.azure.com/</a> and try the tenant deletion again.</p>
<p>What happened in the end? I was able to add our production <code>ourfirm.co.jp</code> domain to our production tenant and we&rsquo;re ready to migrate!</p>
<p>I hope this little story might help anyone who happens upon it.</p>

			 <p>My wife told me about an awful thing happening in Japan. Some hunters who use &ldquo;gun dogs&rdquo; or &ldquo;scent hounds&rdquo; to flush out prey, will abandon them in the forest, chained up at the end of the hunting season in early spring, or let them stray, after which they get picked up and taken to a shelter. These people are really scum to be treating an innocent dog so cruelly like that. However, there’s good people out there trying to help.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Rie Kaneko from Chiba set up <a href="https://cac-ichikawa.com/">Gundog Rescue CACI (Japanese)</a> in 1993 to provide shelter and retrain gun dogs, even working with hunting organizations. You can read about her organization <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13353372">in this article (English)</a>. She mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Only a few inconsiderate hunters abandon gundogs, and it (the hunters’ organization) hopes bird-hunting canines can live happily until the last moment of their lives, just like us,” Kaneko said. “I want to deepen our mutual understanding.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to read that, but it&rsquo;s still disheartening to learn that these dogs are trained for hunting, used for the purpose, then treated like trash when they are no longer needed.</p>
<p>Makiko Matsumoto in Okayama, founded the non-profit <a href="https://www.scenthoundrescue0701.com/">Scenthound Rescue (Japanese)</a> to do a similar thing, and there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.scenthoundrescue0701.com/news">a listing</a> of dogs looking for homes, as well as a listing of <a href="https://www.scenthoundrescue0701.com/%E5%8D%92%E6%A5%AD%E7%94%9F%E7%B4%B9%E4%BB%8B">scenthounds that have been adopted (Japanese but photos)</a>.</p>
<p>Mina Martinez, also from Chiba, runs a general sanctuary called <a href="https://www.animosanctuary.com/">AnimO (English)</a> or &ldquo;Animal Oasis&rdquo; to take care of various animals in need. What a collection they have, and the site is quite educational. You can read more about Mina <a href="https://metropolisjapan.com/love-for-the-abandoned/">in this article (English)</a>.</p>
<p>In the 10 minutes it takes to make coffee, on average another shelter dog has been killed in Japan. It&rsquo;s not just a Japan problem, but a problem world wide. If that bothers you, and it should, what you can do is, &ldquo;<strong>adopt don&rsquo;t shop</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been 30 years since we got married. To celebrate, we booked a tour of Shimane and Tottori prefectures, and had a fantastic time. We did a tour so we could not have to plan, and drink without worrying about someone having to drive. We took the bullet train from Shin Yokohama to Okayama, then went on the tour bus to Adachi Museum, then to Tamazukuri Onsen for the first night. The second day was on to the Shimane Winery, Izumo Taisha shrine, then Misasa Onsen. The final day was the old warehouse town of Kurayoshi, the Tottori Port, and finally the Tottori Sand Dunes before heading back to Okayama. I&rsquo;ll give some details in this post. ♨️🫃🏼</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="getting-there">Getting There</h3>
<p>We left our house at 7am, and made our way to JR Shin-Yokohama station, to get on the bullet train. We bought our lunches, boarded the Nozomi on time, and just enjoyed the trip. The tour included reserved &ldquo;green car&rdquo; (first class) tickets, and the seats were quite nice, comfortable, and included outlets to charge the devices. The Nozomi is an express service, and stops in only a handful of places. We got to Okayama in no time, then walked a ways to the bus terminal. We stowed our bags, boarded, and we were off. Next stop, the Adachi Museum.</p>
<h3 id="adachi-museum">Adachi Museum</h3>
<p>We arrived after a couple hours in the bus. The garden is so well maintained and lovely, you can see why it wins awards, and the Takeuchi Seiho retrospective, the Waterscapes exhibit and the Rosanjin Hall all were such a pleasure to get to view up close. Such masterful detail. The Adachi Museum of Art was a sensory overload and well worth visiting.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3644.jpg" alt="Adachi Museum Garden"></p>
<h3 id="tamazukuri-onsen">Tamazukuri Onsen</h3>
<p>Next, on to an Japanese style &ldquo;Ryokan&rdquo; inn, in the the hot spring town Tamazukuri Onsen. Kasuien Minami was a wonderful experience. A traditional feel while being modern at the same time, the staff, the room, the baths, the award-winning garden and the food were all top notch. We had about 17 hours here, so we took advantage of the large bathing complex several times, enjoyed a huge multi-course &ldquo;kaiseki&rdquo; meal, and just relaxed. We got up early, took another bath, and had probably the best breakfast we&rsquo;d ever experienced in any hotel or inn. The amount of choice was positively decadent. Just amazing. Afterwards, we got ready, checked out, and took a walk around the town to see the local deity statuary all around the river walk area. It was cool that they had QR codes to let you view a translation of the Japanese signage.</p>

<h3 id="shimane-winery-and-train-to-izumo-taisha">Shimane Winery and Train to Izumo Taisha</h3>
<p>The next stop was the Shimane Winery for lunch and a little tasting. We were pleasantly surprised that the lunch was so good. It was meant to be quick, but, it was kaiseki quality, and the wagyu steak and sashimi was divine. The winery gift shop had a tasting bar which was closed, so we made do with some free samples of the various wines, and settled on a pair of wines that are specially made for November, when the gods come to visit Izumo Taisha.</p>
<p>Then a short jaunt around an interesting lake just off shore, to the train station. The train line we took uses recycled train cars from Tokyo, so we immediately felt nostalgic riding this train. The train has a rare switchback station, and so the train gets turned around so that if you were facing the lake, you&rsquo;re now facing the mountains. It took about an hour on the train to get to the station nearest Izumo Taisha shrine, but the scenery was really worth it - really lovely, and felt like a Miyazaki anime.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3708.jpg" alt="Train to Izumo Taisha"></p>
<h3 id="izumo-taisha">Izumo Taisha</h3>
<p>If Ise Jingu shrine is the number one since it houses Amaterasu, Izumo Taisha, or more correctly &ldquo;Izumo Ohyashiro&rdquo;, is the clear number two, housing the rest of the many, many gods. In Japan, the old way to refer to the tenth lunar month (generally equivalent to November) is 神無月 &ldquo;kannazuki&rdquo; or &ldquo;the month without gods&rdquo; while at Izumo Taisha, it&rsquo;s known as 神在月 or &ldquo;kamiarizuki&rdquo; or &ldquo;the month <em>with</em> gods&rdquo;. We visited right during the crowded festival week, welcoming the gods back to the shrine. It was explained that the gods gather to hold discussions on matchmaking, determining the fates of their worshippers. Ceremonies and festivals held during this time are supposed to be sober, quiet affairs so as not to disturb their deliberations.</p>
<p>Our guide was a young person in her 20s from Okayama who said she was the oldest of 8 siblings, and she was really knowledgeable. She obviously had studied quite hard, and gave us an endless stream of informational anecdotes and tidbits about everything along the way in the bus, but also of course about Izumo Taisha. If I remember right, she said it was the only shrine where you go down into it, rather than up a bunch of steps. The four great torii gates were magnificent, although the largest one was under wraps, being restored or repaired in some way. The great しめ縄 &ldquo;shimenawa&rdquo; which you&rsquo;ll see in the pictures was truly imposing, especially when you&rsquo;re right under it making your offerings. As we explored, we also saw a very large flag of Japan, along with several wedding processions.</p>
<p>One point about making an offering at Izumo Taisha is, the process is two bows, <em>four</em> claps, and one bow, rather than the customary two claps at most shrines. The lay explanation for the 4 claps is given as standing for 幸せ, “shi-a-wa-se” or happiness, but the real etymology is supposed to be the saying 一霊四魂, or the four key aspects of a spirit: action, peace, loving protection &amp; knowledge. I dug into this a little, and it appears that although this is only done on one day of the year now at a spring festival, the custom used to be <em>eight</em> claps, because 8 on its side looks like the infinity symbol.</p>
<p>Other thing we learned was, while the best coins to put in the offering box are either 5 or 50 yen ones (the ones with the holes) since &ldquo;go en&rdquo; means good relationships, you can also put combinations like a 10 yen and 1 yen coin, or a 100 yen and a 10 yen coin. I&rsquo;ll need to study about this a bit more.</p>
<p>At any rate, remembering &ldquo;shi-a-wa-se&rdquo; is easy enough, and my wife and I prayed at several locations in the grounds for our daughters to have good fortune in their lives and relationships, as well as for our own health.</p>

<h3 id="misasa-onsen">Misasa Onsen</h3>
<p>Next stop, Misasa Onsen. Izanro Iwasaki in Misasa Onsen is a wonderful older ryokan establishment, with friendly staff, clean rooms and facilities, really comfortable futon beds and pillows, fantastic food and a lovely garden that you can go out into. We even saw a frog in a pond in the garden, how appropriate for Japan. The views from our room were just super, and we could see the wide river and mountains from it. There’s a public bath right near the bridge, and we could see some tiny naked bathers enjoying it from our room. The bathing area is really large with many baths, and even has a radon steam room, the area being famous for that (there’s even a Marie Curie statue). The lounge area outside the baths on the first floor has coffee milk in a vending machine, and some delicious local ice cream to enjoy while you lounge around.</p>
<p>Tottori had a big quake in 2016, and there was unfortunate damage then to a famous teahouse in the garden. Maybe related, but the little town area on the other side of the river had some shuttered inns and looked pretty run down, but, there was a quaint little “ashiyu” foot bath over there, which we wished we had time for. We got a lot more soaking and eating and wandering in, before we left on the bus for the &ldquo;white warehouse&rdquo; area around 10am.</p>

<h3 id="kurayoshi-shirakabe-white-warehouse-district">Kurayoshi Shirakabe White Warehouse District</h3>
<p>Next we did a one hour tour at Kurayoshi &ldquo;Shirakabe&rdquo; White Warehouses in Tottori, and it was fascinating! The warehouses were from various eras from Edo to Meiji, with glass that was warped due to the manufacturing methods of the day. The guide showed us all the various differences from era to era, from building heights to construction styles, which was really cool. The red &ldquo;Sesshu&rdquo; tiles looked lovely against the white walls and black burnt cedar wood skirtings. It was great to learn about the architectural style of these protected buildings.</p>
<p>One oddity was that several shops had life sized &ldquo;sexy anime mascot girl&rdquo; cutouts in their store fronts. Maybe &ldquo;otaku&rdquo; types would like it, but, these were jarring and added nothing to the history or attraction of the place. Our regret here was that we wished the tour let us have time to browse a bit as there was a craft beer brewery shop, a cool looking café, gallery, local goods, and others which were beckoning. Also it was raining. They say “<em>in Tottori, even if you forget your bento, don’t forget an umbrella</em>” because the wet weather there is so unpredictable.</p>
<p>Next was lunch at the port, and on to the dunes.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3762.jpg" alt="Sesshu Tile"></p>
<h3 id="tottori-dunes">Tottori Dunes</h3>
<p>The Tottori sand dunes, our last stop, were quite impressive as well. We got a brief explanation from the “dune meister” then set off to climb the big one that we saw from the top of the stairs. It&rsquo;s about 63m the meister said, and about twice the height of Jockey&rsquo;s Ridge in Kitty Hawk for comparison. The tour had us wear plastic shop bags over our shoes, but not many other people were wearing them and sand got in anyway. It was chilly weather in November, so the jackets we had came in handy. It had rained earlier so the sand was supposedly a little easier to walk on, but it was a bit aerobic to get to the top.</p>
<p>We walked about 1.5km on sand (harder than it seems) then headed back toward the bus, stopping for coffee in the shop in the cool building in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Then it was back on the bus, and back to Okayama to get some last minute omiyage gifts, then head home on the ever-reliable shinkansen.</p>
<p>What a great way to spend 3 days out of our 30 year history so far. Here&rsquo;s to 30 more! ❤️</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;re trying to learn <code>*nix</code> command line, whether you&rsquo;re on a Mac, Linux, the Linux subsystem in Windows or something else, here&rsquo;s a few pointers and tips that you might find useful:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p>In my opinion, don&rsquo;t try to learn every command deeply, but rather learn the basics, take a while to get used to it, then circle back for more detail. Use <code>man</code> to learn what you need, when you need it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Idan Kamara created a really useful site called « <a href="https://www.explainshell.com">ExplainShell</a> » that graphically shows what linux commands do. For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.explainshell.com/explain?cmd=tar%20xzvf%20archive.tar.gz">https://www.explainshell.com/explain?cmd=tar%20xzvf%20archive.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>It kind of looks like what you’d draw on a whiteboard, if you were giving a lecture on a particular command.</p>
<p>In a similar vein is <a href="https://cheat.sh">https://cheat.sh</a>, from <a href="https://micro.blog/igor">@igor</a>_chubin.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you want to share your terminal sessions with other learners, try out the free and open source «<a href="https://asciinema.org">@Asciinema</a>» service, which lets you record your terminal sessions for sharing. Slick.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you need a remote Linux server to learn on, create an account on free sites like <a href="ctrl-c.club">ctrl-c.club</a>, <a href="tilde.club">tilde.club</a> or <a href="tilde.town">tilde.town</a>. Don’t be a dick, though.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zsh is a good interactive shell to use. «<a href="https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans">Zsh for Humans</a>» (z4h by @romkatv on GitHub) is a configuration for z-shell that just works and works well. It has a killer <code>ssh</code> wrapper feature, that lets you auto-push your zsh environment up to a remote server, and is pre-configured with the most useful stuff. That is not to even mention the awesome prompt it includes: <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">powerlevel10k</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 20221204</strong>: <code>zsh4humans</code> isn&rsquo;t maintained per the github repo, so you might want to check out <a href="https://zimfw.sh/">zim</a> instead.</p>
<hr>
<p>« <a href="https://daseldocs.tomwright.me/">Dasel</a> » from Tom Wright @tomwright1993, is a truly cool tool. It uses a standard DAta SELector syntax, so you can learn it once, then use it for converting and querying files of various oft-used types. 🆒</p>
<p>It lets you do something similar to <code>jq</code> or <code>yq</code>, but it supports JSON, YAML, TOML, XML or CSV. Say you have a simple json file which you need in yaml. Just do this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; dasel select -f website.json
{
  &quot;ErrorDocument&quot;: {
    &quot;Key&quot;: &quot;404.html&quot;
  },
  &quot;IndexDocument&quot;: {
    &quot;Suffix&quot;: &quot;index.html&quot;
  },
  &quot;RoutingRules&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;Condition&quot;: {
        &quot;KeyPrefixEquals&quot;: &quot;/&quot;
      },
      &quot;Redirect&quot;: {
        &quot;ReplaceKeyWith&quot;: &quot;index.html&quot;
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Easily convert to <code>yaml</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; dasel select -f website.json -p yaml
ErrorDocument:
  Key: 404.html
IndexDocument:
  Suffix: index.html
RoutingRules:
- Condition:
    KeyPrefixEquals: /
  Redirect:
    ReplaceKeyWith: index.html
</code></pre>
<p>And boom.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you need a super simple way to cryptographically sign a file, such as a software release, try « <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a> », from @jedisct1.</p>
<hr>
<p>« <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt">Dolt</a> is git for data » as their repo says. 😎 A SQL database with git features, Dolt lets you push, pull, clone, branch, merge, do all the git things as well as all the sql things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even DoltHub, where you can host public data such as this <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/kimjonggyu/holidays/query/master?q=SELECT+*%0AFROM+%60public_holidays%60%0AWHERE+countryCode+%3D+%22JP%22%0ALIMIT+200%3B%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A&amp;active=">holidays</a> dataset. It has tools like permissions, and a SQL query interface as well.</p>
<hr>
<p>Try substituting «<a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a>» for <code>cat</code>. <code>Bat</code> is a fast (written in Rust) <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting for programming and markup languages, integration with your $PAGER, and git index awareness.</p>
<hr>
<p>« <a href="https://the.exa.website/"><code>Exa</code></a> » (<code>@dot_slash_exa</code>) is a superb modern and fast <code>ls</code> replacement that supports colors, file and filesystem info, tree view, git info, and wide view. You have plenty of compute power, so why not take advantage of it and use something better than <code>ls</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you cannot dig <code>dig</code> for cli dns lookup, you might try « <a href="https://dns.lookup.dog"><code>dog</code></a> », written in Rust by Benjamin Sago @cairnrefinery (who also wrote the lovely <code>exa</code>) or « <a href="https://github.com/natesales/q"><code>q</code></a> », written in Go by Nate Sales. 😎</p>
<p>I especially like how you can output json from <code>dog</code> for consumption by another program for say, pushing to a database:</p>
<pre><code>{

			 <p>I finally got my proper Japan driver&rsquo;s license, and what an ordeal it&rsquo;s been. Fasten your seatbelts for this one and just note that you must convert, and cannot drive on an IDP for more than one year. Anyway, here goes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-incident">The incident</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in Japan since 1987 and did not drive for the first 4 or 5 years. I always have kept my US license current, and after getting married, got and started using an international license. Never had a problem buying cars, mopeds, or insurance using the international license. They expire yearly, and recently had always bought them online via AAA, and they&rsquo;d come in the post a couple weeks later.</p>
<p>I had a couple fender benders and a couple citations over the years, but nothing major, and no cop ever questioned the international license. But about three years ago, it was my lucky day I guess: got pulled over and the cop told me you can only use an int&rsquo;l for 1 year, meaning, I was driving without a license or guilty of &ldquo;mumenkyo unten&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cue getting carted off to the police station in the back of a cruiser, a scary interview process, signing a statement, getting my wife pulled in as well (so sorry) and interviewed because the car&rsquo;s in her name, then finally released. We got called back separately for more interviews and finally they decided to just limit it to me. They could have charged and fined her too, for allowing an unlicensed person to drive her car. We would have really been in trouble had they not been charitable to us in the weeks following.</p>
<p>I was feeling sick for a long time after this. Fearing the absolute worst because this offense can come with prison time, I contacted a lawyer. He told me if I wasn&rsquo;t in cuffs and locked up, it wasn&rsquo;t an arrest per se, albeit of course a serious issue. This eased my mind somewhat. He told me to just be sincere and honest, and advised me not to change the story.</p>
<p>In about a month I had to appear before the prosecutor &amp; judge, paid a 300,000 JPY fine, and had to go to a day&rsquo;s training regarding the rules: there would be no chance of getting a license for 2 years, mandatory 2 day course for people who lose their license. After the course they interview you to make sure you understand, and the cop told it&rsquo;s easiest to stay in US for 90d over a three year period, then convert. Conversion means you hand in a translation of your license and proof that you&rsquo;ve been in the US (not sure re other countries) for the required 90 days over three years, take an eye test and simple 10 question written test, and take a driving test. I hear they fail you a few times, but it&rsquo;s a cheap process compared to going to a school. Some countries and some US states (OH, WA, HI I think?) are exempt from the testing; you just do an eye test and <em>bam</em>, you&rsquo;re licensed.</p>
<h3 id="going-to-school">Going to school</h3>
<p>I started trying to get the 90 days in the US, and was up to 60 days, but COVID messed with those plans. Eventually my wife got tired of driving us everywhere so she insisted I just pay to take the course at a school. I went to the certified &ldquo;kounin&rdquo; school in Totsuka where we are, and to get your regular car license at any of such school is about 300,000 JPY.</p>
<p>There are schools that offer English language courses but they are not so convenient for me, so I opted for Japanese lessons with English tests. My Japanese is good, but my kanji reading is too slow to be competitive in a test situation. It&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> of training, and textbook facts you have to memorize. I know how to drive so I had to tamp down the annoyance, and try to keep a beginners&rsquo; mindset. The biggest challenge was, I&rsquo;m 56, so memorizing is not my strong suit right about now.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;stance&rdquo; during all this was to keep an earnest sincerity, and kind of over-exaggerate all the checks and so on, that you&rsquo;re meant to do. Basically, when I took the driver test in PA in the US in 81, it was like getting tossed off a cliff. Our gym teacher at HS was the driving instructor, and while we did have a primitive driving simulator in the basement of the HS, the training was little to non-existent.</p>
<p>So for this class in Japan, I decided to make the best of it, ask a ton of questions and get them to explain a lot. Especially with regard to driving skills that, while I could do them, I can&rsquo;t say I felt confident about. Due to the step by step nature of the training and the repetition, I have to say I&rsquo;m a lot more confident about things like backing up, parallel parking and so on.</p>
<p>The training is in two stages and breaks down like this:</p>
<h4 id="stage-1">Stage 1</h4>
<ol>
<li>Take a psych test to find out your &ldquo;driver personality&rdquo;</li>
<li>Classes on basic knowledge</li>
<li>Practice driving basics inside the school grounds on their test course</li>
<li>Pass practice tests using &ldquo;mantensama&rdquo; online site</li>
<li>Pass &ldquo;koukasokutei&rdquo; 50-question true-false test after all classwork, which focuses on the classes you&rsquo;ve taken so far</li>
<li>Pass &ldquo;mikiwame&rdquo; driving test, which says you&rsquo;re ready for the actual test</li>
<li>Pass the &ldquo;karimen&rdquo; driving test</li>
<li>Get your &ldquo;karimen&rdquo; learner&rsquo;s permit, with which you can drive on the streets when accompanied by person with a license</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="stage-2">Stage 2</h4>
<ol>
<li>Classes on intermediate knowledge</li>
<li>Practice driving basics outside the school on regular roads</li>
<li>First aid &ldquo;set&rdquo; class, 3 hr</li>
<li>Other &ldquo;set&rdquo; classes, such as &ldquo;expressway driving&rdquo; class, followed by actual expressway driving, or &ldquo;emergency maneuvers&rdquo; followed by some fun experiences like taking a curve at higher speed than normal or, slamming on the brakes to see how the car reacts at 40 kph</li>
<li>Pass practice tests using &ldquo;mantensama&rdquo; online site</li>
<li>Pass &ldquo;koukasokutei&rdquo; 90-question true-false test after all classwork, which focuses on stage 2 classroom learning with a little review of stage 1 learning, and is similar to the actual licensing exam</li>
<li>Pass &ldquo;mikiwame&rdquo; driving test, which says you&rsquo;re ready for the actual test</li>
<li>Pass &ldquo;sotsugyo&rdquo; driving test</li>
<li>Graduation ceremony, explanation of taking the written test at the DMV, and get your graduation certificate, and some other papers you need to present when taking the written test</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot, and it&rsquo;s really designed to get a person with no experience at all, up to speed to be able to drive relatively safely. For that, I think it serves its purpose well. Despite knowing how to drive, I found myself nodding my head in agreement with the instructors, many around my age, when they were emphasizing some point to the classes (mostly late teens early 20s) about how dangerous an accident can be, or whatnot. Most of the many, many instructors I interacted with were excellent ranging in age from late 20s to around 60.</p>
<p>The two hardest parts for me were first, the memorization (it&rsquo;s just not so easy at 56) and second, not exceeding the posted speed limit. Thirty kph really feels too slow.</p>
<h3 id="remedial-training">Remedial training</h3>
<p>Before I could get the karimen learner&rsquo;s permit, I had to take the remedial two day course for people who have had their license confiscated - when I scheduled it, the person arranged it so I could take the course more near my house, which was a relief. I arrived at the school near Kamioooka at 8am, and my classmates were a guy who drove drunk and another who got caught speeding way over the limit.</p>
<p>The initial psych test they have you take on day one at the regular school gives you an idea of how you&rsquo;ll react in various situations. They ask many questions designed to tease out your personality, and also give tests that are designed to induce stress, as in, making the same mark on paper as fast as you can for a one minute period: how many X&rsquo;s can you make, crossing a backward slash.</p>
<p>I did not do &ldquo;well&rdquo; on this initial test, partially because of irritation about it, and partially because the explanations were fast and I wasn&rsquo;t following well. Then, surprise, surprise, there was another one during this two day course!</p>
<p>However, this time I knew what to expect, and did much better, with a normal result. The instructor also explained it better as well. He was really encouraging and got us psyched up to do it, and all of us got an acceptable result.</p>
<p>I think also it helped that this instructor, an ex cop, was empathetic and funny. He knew this course and the whole thing about losing your license would have been a stress and an embarrassment, and basically handled the whole two days with humor. Of the three of us, one fellow was at the point I was at, just before the &ldquo;karimen&rdquo; and the other fellow had already graduated. The instructor joked that he was going to make the graduate backup through the &ldquo;crank&rdquo; (a series of narrow 90 degree turns you have to negotiate), and that if he couldn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d have to tell his school to rescind the graduated status. Sounds mean, but it was funny and broke the tension.</p>
<h3 id="formal-steps-and-graduating">Formal steps and graduating</h3>
<p>Regarding the two driving tests you take during the course of the schoolwork, they are formal and there are specific sets of steps that you must complete. This was a bit of a challenge because before each test, the instructors are explaining very quickly, and if your listening comprehension is not 100% on that day, you might miss something. I asked them to repeat just in case I missed; things like &ldquo;so, after we stop, we&rsquo;re to turn off the engine and get out of the car, checking behind, otherwise it&rsquo;s a fail, right?&rdquo; I imagine that might have helped another student who missed the point, since they said you&rsquo;d fail if you missed it.</p>
<p>Regarding the &ldquo;sets of steps&rdquo; I mentioned, I mean a process like, before starting, you:</p>
<ul>
<li>inspect the vehicle,</li>
<li>get in checking to the rear,</li>
<li>confirm parking brake and that the gear is in P,</li>
<li>press engine button twice / turn key to aux,</li>
<li>confirm mirrors and seat position,</li>
<li>verbally say you&rsquo;re ready,</li>
<li>fasten seatbelt,</li>
<li>turn on engine,</li>
<li>put gear in D,</li>
<li>release side brake,</li>
<li>check mirrors,</li>
<li>signal,</li>
<li>turn and check blind spot,</li>
<li>go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, when changing lanes or turning, it&rsquo;s:</p>
<ul>
<li>check back mirror,</li>
<li>check relevant side mirror,</li>
<li>signal,</li>
<li>check blind spot,</li>
<li>turn</li>
</ul>
<p>I found it was useful to do some image training, thinking about these steps, and then do them every time I drove. You can get in a lot of practice before the test, if you memorize it up front and just repeatedly do it how they expect. It&rsquo;s a bit of a challenge to unlearn shortcuts you&rsquo;ve been taking for many years, though.</p>
<p>The final driving test was a lot easier than I thought it would be, and you&rsquo;re paired up with another person. In my case, my partner was around 20, had never driven, and passed even though though they cut off a car coming straight while they were turning right. When the instructors were coming out to give us the results after taking the final test, I overheard my partner say &ldquo;I know I screwed up badly&hellip;&rdquo;, and the instructor respond &ldquo;yes, but you have done everything else right so far, so I am going to pass you. Just please be careful in those situations since you can&rsquo;t know what someone else will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once you graduate, you don&rsquo;t need to go back to the school, but you&rsquo;ve just got the the final written test, which is only given at the DMV test center. In our case, it&rsquo;s the Kanagawa Driver Center near Futamatagawa station in Yokohama. Before you could just show up and take the test, but due to COVID, now you register online and there&rsquo;s a bit of a wait. We had to wait a month. I graduated on 22 Feb and took the written test on 22 Mar 2022. During the month of waiting, unfortunately I could feel the facts kind of slipping away out of my brain, so I studied regularly using mantensama, and my own notes.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-written-test">The final written test</h3>
<p>The test center was a madhouse, but thankfully everyone was masked. Reception was supposed to be from 8:30 to 9:00am, so I arrived at 8:15. They were already processing people in, and it was already very crowded. When I got to the front of the line, I handed over my various papers including graduation certificate, proof I had taken the 2-day remedial course, and answers on a questionnaire about not having epilepsy or narcolepsy. I emphasized that I wanted to take the test in English, and the cop doing my check-in told me I need to fill out the form in English instead. So I did that, re-queued, and then got passed over to the eye test line.</p>
<p>The eye test was literally 30 seconds: you look into a machine like they have at the ophthalmologist, and say whether the opening in the C is up, down, left or right. Then you get directed to a waiting room. In my case, since my test was to be in English, they directed me to wait with other such testees, and in a few minutes another official came out to check our paperwork and direct us to the test rooms.</p>
<p>After a bit more waiting, and people scrambling down to the convenience store on the first floor to buy pencils (!) since they no longer provide them due to COVID, they passed the tests out and walked us through how to fill out the answer sheet. In the case of the foreign language testers, there were special codes to enter, so an official came over and filled bits of the sheet in for us.</p>
<p>The test in English had a different odd grammar from the odd grammar of the practice tests, so that was a bit of a jolt. The test is 90 questions in 50 min, and I used up 40 of the 50 min, handed it in, then went to a special kiosk to get a barcode slip with the license PIN on it, and pay the 2100 yen for the license fee. Actually, as is typical in Japan, you buy stamps to affix to a physical form.</p>
<p>Once everyone was done with the test I went back in and sat down, and waited for the result. They display the &ldquo;jukenbango&rdquo; numbers of the people who passed on the screen. Maybe 10 of about 100 people in the room failed, and were told to leave the room. But, there&rsquo;s my number, a pass!</p>
<p>Next they explain the rest of the process, including optional membership in the &ldquo;safety club&rdquo; which is 1500 yen for the license validity period, and has the main benefit of giving you a kind of &ldquo;fast pass&rdquo; letting you skip the line when you renew the next time. Sounds like a good deal to me, so I paid it. Maybe 5 of 90 of the others joined.</p>
<p>Finally, they came in with the licenses, and call people by the number of their birthday month, so since I&rsquo;m Jan, I was in the first group. You get the license, hand in your permit, then leave. One last step is, to use a kiosk to check the info in the license. All good! Now I just need to remember to put the &ldquo;beginner mark&rdquo; magnets on the car any time I drive. Luckily the school gave us these as a graduation present.</p>
<h3 id="interesting-trivia">Interesting trivia</h3>
<p>Congrats, you made it to the end! Some interesting facts I picked up:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can be cited for &ldquo;failure to render first aid&rdquo; if you don&rsquo;t use your first aid knowledge during an accident, whether it&rsquo;s your fault or not.</li>
<li>If your car runs out of gas or breaks down on the expressway, you can be cited for &ldquo;failure to maintain your vehicle&rdquo;.</li>
<li>You can be cited for staying in the passing lane on the expressway.</li>
<li>If you ride the expressway, it&rsquo;s a requirement to have one of those triangle reflectors to put out in case of a breakdown.</li>
<li>Getting a citation or having points subtracted during the first year is a problem; you can be made to take a two day remedial class, then redo all the tests. What a pain. Drive carefully that first year!</li>
<li>If you get another more advanced license, like &ldquo;jun-chuugata&rdquo; (small truck), during the first year, the aforementioned strictness is applied to the more advanced of whatever license you have. So, if you have &ldquo;jun-chuugata&rdquo; and get cited while driving your normal car, that does not count as a citation against your first-year &ldquo;beginner period&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If you are in an accident even if it&rsquo;s minor, never run and always call the police. Something that seems minor in the context of your home country is probably not seen as minor in Japan. The example given was bumping mirrors. They are designed to fold back, but even that is classed as an &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and you still have to call the cops, even if both drivers agree it&rsquo;s nothing. Better to do it right, than to risk having someone come at you later.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Before COVID I used to walk to JR Totsuka station here in Yokohama, every day for my commute to Tokyo. It was a good opportunity to listen to a podcast, and I have several favorites from Mozilla, NPR, PRX, WYNC, CIR and others that I&rsquo;ll share here. #trypod</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Although there&rsquo;s English news in Japan (I&rsquo;ve paid so much in newspaper subscription fees for the last 34 years I&rsquo;m practically an investor), I like radio, and Podcasts are a great radio-like way to keep up with what is going on <em>outside</em> our little archipelago. I can&rsquo;t stand queuing, but we do a lot of it while waiting for trains, so, podcasts come in handy to fill in that void. Also they are great for the train ride itself, too.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to these podcasts from Apple iTunes, apps like Overcast or Castro on iPhone (I don&rsquo;t have an Android but there are a bunch of apps you can use like &ldquo;BeyondPod&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stitcher Radio&rdquo; and others), or on apps from the podcast producers, like NPR&rsquo;s &ldquo;NPR One&rdquo; app.</p>

			 <p>Our dog &ldquo;Maru&rdquo;, a male Shiba, is going through a rebellious phase now at 11 months old. Our trainer told us Shibas especially go through a phase between 6 and 18 months where they seem to forget every bit of their training, won&rsquo;t listen to commands, won&rsquo;t eat, won&rsquo;t crate, forget there they&rsquo;re supposed to pee; all manner of fun stuff. Yep, it&rsquo;s happening. He&rsquo;s being extra difficult now, but there are still flashes of that obedient, cute little guy from, um, two weeks ago!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When it happens you just need to accept it, but also be smart about it. As the &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; you can&rsquo;t let him get away with everything, but as long as he is not tearing the place apart, we are finding that if we just chill and let him chill, he&rsquo;s more receptive to commands.</p>
<p>He has to take antihistamines for allergies, and thankfully has not started to resist the miracle-working &ldquo;medi-balls&rdquo;. These are balls with a marzipan-like consistency, into which you put a pill. We mostly never have trouble with giving him meds if we put it in a medi-ball. Good stuff.</p>
<h3 id="how-about-now-in-autumn-2023">How about now in Autumn 2023?</h3>
<p>He has been through one more of these phases, and is in yet another one now, as he approaches three. But we still love him to bits.</p>

			 <p>A while back, the morning news in Japan did an unironic piece on &ldquo;how much is too much reclining&rdquo; in trains and planes. The result was, most people in Japan felt that <code>40.4 cm (15.90551 in)</code> was the max they wanted someone in front of them to recline. In typical Japan News fashion, they measured distances and angles, and got a cute little girl to say when she felt uncomfortable when the man in front reclined. (What burns <em>my</em> cookies is not the reclining <em>per se</em>, but when the person in front of you reclines violently and suddenly.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway, this sort of detail is typical in Japan, and it&rsquo;s something my western friends and I find rather humorous. For example, they go into incessant detail about wind speed and <em>hectopascals</em> of barometric pressure, compleat with demonstrations from poor schlub in the field going &ldquo;yep, this gale force wind is realllly hard to walk in&rdquo;. I, for one, expect my news broadcast numbers to be reported with six decimals of precision. :-p</p>
<p>Of course many Japanese are aware of this tendency, and have done some excellent comedy taking the piss regarding it. Here are a couple funny examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe0idflAic4">The Japanese Tradition, Tea</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG6oT5kYI0Y">The Japanese Tradition, Dogeza Apology</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeaN4pJeIfk">The Japanese Tradition, Onigiri Rice Balls</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I promise, those are meant to be comedy, despite the assertions from the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; in the comments section. (God save us).</p>

			 <p>Of course there are people who live by creating trouble as their <em>raison d&rsquo;être</em>, like Baron Munchausen. In my thinking, life dishes out trouble anyway and automatically, so why make it more difficult? It may be cliché to say, but better to be part of the solution, rather than the problem.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>People who are constantly negative are as impractical in thought, as people who are constantly positive. People who make even more mistakes to compound the problem as the pressure mounts, then bail, are another good example. As are people who fail to plan at all, or people who blurt out problems expecting magic, as though nobody else ever noticed it and just failed to wave their magic wand to fix it. Another example is people who insist on looping you in to their every issue.</p>
<p>I strive to not be an example of the above. I like people who fix problems and will fix problems with me, and try to cultivate relationships with them.</p>
<p><strong>N.b.:</strong> &ldquo;Munchausen Syndrome&rdquo; is colloquially called <em>&ldquo;match pump&rdquo;</em> in Japanese. S/he who lights the match also yields the pump. Very descriptive. Almost poetic.</p>

			 <p>Thinking about motivation and how to motivate, I came to a conclusion that works for me. Praising someone for what they are already good at, is a waste of an interaction. The person being praised learns nothing, especially if you or others have said it before. The praiser misses a chance to make any sort of difference, and can fall into a rut of doing nothing to improve or better themselves.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to guide someone in the direction of things they don&rsquo;t like to do or are not good at, then praise them when they do it. Such as when a person, perhaps an &ldquo;introvert&rdquo;, who fears and avoids confrontation, takes the plunge and confronts a difficult person in their life. Or when a decidedly non-athletic person makes a big effort to get out there and do something more athletic, even if it&rsquo;s just walking around the block to start. Or when a person develops job skills that they never thought they&rsquo;d be able to. I think praise in those circumstances has lasting meaning.</p>
<p>Conversely, praising a talented athlete for being great athletically, or a student who never has to study to do well, for getting good grades, is just a waste.</p>
<p>Through the lens of living in Japan, people criticize more when you&rsquo;re <em>uchi</em> rather than <em>soto</em>. When you are <em>uchi</em>, a part of the group (the family, company, or club), the criticism can be harsh, because &ldquo;otherwise, who else would ever say this.&rdquo; And usually, we don&rsquo;t direct too much criticism at someone outside the group, at someone who is <em>soto</em>. However it feels dysfunctional to me, no matter how many years I have lived in Japan, to harshly criticize someone just because they&rsquo;re a group member, and you can. I want to remember that words can be weapons.</p>
<p>Hopefully I am neither too harsh nor sweet, giving praise where it counts most, and therefore succeeding to motivate people to do better.</p>

			 <p>I like comedy because laughter makes me feel better, while the heavy stuff comes for free. What about in Japan? Japan has some interesting comedy or &ldquo;owarai&rdquo; styles that are good to know for learners of Japanese. It might be really, really esoteric to those who don&rsquo;t speak any Japanese, but if you&rsquo;re trying to get from intermediate to advanced <em>any</em> language, you could do worse than to listen to, and learn some comedy in that language.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Japan has some types of humor such as the performed styles manzai, rakugo, or konto, and written styles like senryu.</p>
<p><strong>Manzai</strong> (漫才) acts are almost always a &ldquo;double act&rdquo; pair like Abbott and Costello, and it&rsquo;s characterized by rapid fire talk, back and forth between a &ldquo;tsukkomi&rdquo; straight man, and a &ldquo;boke&rdquo; funny man. The M-1 Grand Prix is a great Manzai act competition. Manzai acts I like are Waraimeshi (&ldquo;double boke&rdquo; style switching the boke role between them), Tutorial (delusional &ldquo;wild idea&rdquo; style) and Slim Club (extra slow delivery).</p>
<p><strong>Rakugo</strong> (落語) is traditionally a lone seated comic, performed with a fan as a prop, with an emphasis on a story. After the success of M-1 Grand Prix for manzai acts, single-performer acts got features on the &ldquo;R-1 Grand Prix&rdquo;. The R comes from Rakugo, even though these acts are usually pretty far removed from traditional rakugo.</p>
<p><strong>Konto</strong> (コント) are skit performances, sometimes quite elaborate and funny. They remind me of the ones Carol Burnett and her troupe used to do on her show. God, I&rsquo;m old.</p>
<p><strong>Senryu</strong> (川柳) especially &ldquo;Salaryman Senryu&rdquo; are haiku-like poems which riff on daily life.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a learner of Japanese and interested in this, just search online for the above words.</p>

			 <p>Are you a project manager or, a manager of MS Project. That is, is your selected tool impeding you rather than helping you? The more time spent fiddling with your tool (an apt metaphor here), the less time you&rsquo;re spending thinking and communicating about how people, things and money fit with your schedule and the goals you&rsquo;re aiming to meet.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There may be projects that require a 5000-line Gantt chart, but even large projects I&rsquo;ve managed have never needed one. Steering committees made up of senior people don&rsquo;t want to sit through a PM droning on while fiddling with a super-detailed Gantt. In fact, most would question the sanity of a PM who shared or presented such a monstrosity.</p>
<p>Instead, I think the better approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>let your teams manage their piece, with whatever documents they want (sometimes compliance proscribes this) and report to you the day before the steering committee meeting.</li>
<li>keep a &ldquo;20,000 ft view&rdquo; Gantt in a Spreadsheet, with 5 or 6 activities, to roughly show where the project is at and just update the dates and status before each meeting.</li>
<li>mark status in a simple &ldquo;GYR&rdquo; manner: Green means good, Yellow means slowed, Red means there&rsquo;s a showstopper. You can use it to focus attention where your executives can provide the most help: getting problems unstuck.</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, there will always be someone who will be a tool about why you&rsquo;re not supplying a detailed Gantt, but don&rsquo;t buckle to that pressure; it’s a fool&rsquo;s errand.</p>
<p>In the end, satisfy the real and pressing requirements of your projects, and stop fiddling with your tools.</p>

			 <p>The other day I had to do three bank transfers for my company, since my business partner who usually takes care of this, couldn&rsquo;t. The bank tellers are really very polite, but it took three hours, and I can&rsquo;t get away from the idea that they are also completely incompetent, albeit really politely.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The thing is, I had only the bank book and the hanko (stamp). If you have the cash card and PIN, it&rsquo;s easy to do a bank transfer. You deal with an ATM only; no people involved. But if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s forms, and forms mean mistakes, especially for a schlub like me whose written Japanese is erm &ldquo;fair&rdquo;, to be charitable. 😅</p>
<p>On getting there at 11AM, I explained the situation, saying what I brought and what I want to do. I got the right forms (there&rsquo;s a different one depending on the target bank). Filled the forms, getting help from the floor teller, whose directions I followed to the letter. It takes me a while to fill them out too, because of course it&rsquo;s all Japanese, this being Japan.</p>
<p>Submitted the forms, waited 20 minutes. Got apologetically called up and told I need to re-write the forms because the order I wrote the company name and my name was incorrect, and, I can&rsquo;t just cross it out. It has to be company name first, then my name and title. Also, I wrote my own title wrong, apparently, despite having been told to enter it that way. But&hellip; the lady out there said&hellip; nevermind. Have a seat&hellip;</p>
<p>So, rewrote the forms how the window teller told me (even flubbed up one from sheer fatigue and re-wrote it), re-submitted, more waiting. Called again. The name on this transfer form is not correct (despite the spelling being exactly what is on the directions I got from the requester). Fixed it to her directions, stamping where I needed to, and for some inexplicable reason they let me cross it out and stamp the affected area. Uhh, but you <em>just said</em>&hellip; nevermind. Have a seat&hellip;</p>
<p>Got called again, this time to write my name and company name on the back of a piece of paper &ldquo;for security reasons&rdquo;. Uhh, ok&hellip; poor writing ensues. Have a seat&hellip;</p>
<p>Called again. Also, your name here, and here, and here is incorrect. It needs middle dots.</p>
<p>In other words, this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>コグレー ジェームズ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; had to be this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>コグレー・ジェームズ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, this time they let me just add the dots, miracle of miracles.</p>
<p>More waiting, wondering if the Wizard of Oz in the back there is having fun or not. Finally, success, at 14:00 after three hours. I hope I never have to do that again. Argh.</p>

			 <p>Robert on Strava says he &ldquo;just takes the stings and calls it free Vespa&rdquo;, which is funny, but Asian Giant Hornets (<em>Vespa mandarinia</em>) in Japan are no joke. Read on to find out why.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sept and Oct is breeding season for the Japanese Hornet, which is when they get aggressive. In Japanese, these are called &ldquo;oo-suzumebachi (オオスズメバチ)&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;great sparrow bee&rdquo; because of their large size. You know you&rsquo;re in trouble when they start clacking their mandibles. You&rsquo;ll hear their buzzing anyway, but when they start in with a clack!-clack! sound, know they&rsquo;re going on the attack.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in Japan and watch the Japanese news, you&rsquo;ll see reports about these regularly. I read that 40-70 people die yearly in Japan from their stings, specifically from anaphylactic shock. These hornets have a re-usable stinger, so they can stick you multiple times. If you approach them, accidentally or on purpose, or are simply in their vicinity, they can attack. One came after me as I was hanging out the laundry, not even near a nest.</p>
<h3 id="black-clothed-loud-perfumed-people-be-gone">Black-clothed, loud, perfumed people be gone!</h3>
<p>They say prevention is half the cure, so, this is what I&rsquo;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay away from their nests, in trees (even low to the ground such as in the roots of a big tree) or the eaves of buildings.</li>
<li>Wear solid white, and avoid creating areas of contrast on your body (like black stripes on a white background).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t wear any scents at all, even scented soaps - keep it boring on the trails in the autumn in Japan.</li>
<li>Do like bee-keepers do - stay calm, slow and quiet. Nobody likes a lot of noise on the trail anyway, but, if they are coming after you, don&rsquo;t swat at them and yell. Go gently and quietly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you <em>do</em> get stung, I read that the best thing to do is to squeeze out the venom (with your fingers, not by sucking), and keep it cold until you can get to a doctor. And multiple stings necessitate such a visit.</p>
<p>Stay safe out there.</p>
<p>⚠️ 🐝 😱</p>
<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<p>A kind reader mentioned something else to keep in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this time of year when outside, avoid drinking fruit juice (particularly grape or citrus) or alcohol. It attracts them like a magnet. (I speak from experience).</p>

			 <p>A question on the Hugo support forum prompted me to try deploying the Hugo <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quickstart</a> site with Ananke Theme, on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>. It was super simple and took only 10 min. Here&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="hugo-quickstart">Hugo Quickstart</h3>
<p>First, just run through the quickstart steps in a local folder to get it basically working. I put my projects in <code>$HOME/dev</code>.</p>
<h3 id="connect-to-vercel-using-their-cli-command">Connect to Vercel using their CLI command</h3>
<p>Assuming you have installed the <code>vercel</code> <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/cli">CLI</a> command locally and have authenticated, you can connect your new Hugo project to your Vercel account by running <code>vercel</code> in the project folder. It prompts you for the basic settings you want for the project, and for a standard Hugo site, <code>./</code> is correct for the code directory:</p>
<pre><code>vercel
Setup and deploy? Y
Which scope? Rick Cogley
(pick user or org, and I picked &quot;Rick Cogley&quot; my account)
Link to existing project? N
Project name: hugo-quickstart
In which directory is your code located? ./
Override settings? N
Deploying...
</code></pre>
<p><em>N.b.: Vercel private / free accounts require non-commercial sites</em></p>
<p>It will start deploying, and return some info about the deployed site.</p>
<pre><code>Want to override the settings? [y/N] N
🔗  Linked to rickcogley/hugo-quickstart (created .vercel and added it to .gitignore)
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/rickcogley/hugo-quickstart/APeDa4... [3s]
✅  Production: https://hugo-quickstart-lilac.vercel.app [copied to clipboard] [28s]
📝  Deployed to production. Run `vercel --prod` to overwrite later (https://vercel.link/2F).
💡  To change the domain or build command, go to https://vercel.com/rickcogley/hugo-quickstart/settings
user=1.07s system=0.25s cpu=0% total=2:39.28
</code></pre>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that it creates a <code>.vercel</code> folder in your project folder, which contains account and project information in a <code>project.json</code>. This folder is added to <code>.gitignore</code> so if you <code>git clone</code> to another system at a later date, you&rsquo;ll need to link it again using <code>vercel</code>.</p>
<p>The site should now be available where Vercel deployed it (it&rsquo;s on the clipboard, so just paste into your browser to check).</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s deployed, and you could simply work from your local folder, and use the <code>vercel</code> CLI command to re-deploy when you need to. However, it&rsquo;s cooler to deploy on git push, so let&rsquo;s get that working next.</p>
<h3 id="minor-tweaks-needed">Minor Tweaks Needed</h3>
<p>Now you can edit your Hugo <code>config.toml</code> adding the URL that Vercel provided as a <code>baseURL</code>, although, it appears that Vercel is smart enough to feed Hugo the production URL anyway.</p>
<p>Also, since Vercel&rsquo;s default Hugo version is really old, copy the <code>vercel.json</code> from my <a href="https://github.com/RickCogley/hugo-quickstart/">test repo</a> for this post, and add it to the base of your project. This will tell Vercel to use that version of Hugo and also set some security headers for you.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-github-repository-and-link-it">Create a GitHub Repository and Link It</h3>
<p>Next, create a repository in your Github, but <em>do not</em> add a README or anything. Then execute these commands from your local project folder, to add your new GH repository as a remote, add and commit the changed / added files, and push to main.</p>
<pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGithubUser/hugo-quickstart.git
git add .
git commit -m &quot;added baseurl to config, added vercel.json&quot;
git branch -M main
git push origin main
</code></pre>
<p>Now in your Vercel project, settings, Git menu, connect Vercel to your Github repo using the button.</p>
<h3 id="test-by-editing-and-pushing">Test by Editing and Pushing</h3>
<p>Then to test, make an edit in the site files (e.g. <code>content/my-first-post.md</code>), push to main, then check the URL that Vercel deployed on. You can watch it deploy in your Vercel project.</p>
<p>And that is it. A very simply process to get a Hugo project linked up to and deployed to Vercel.</p>

			 <p>The other day I <a href="https://blog.cogley.jp/28920/email-services-for-your-apps">wrote about</a> using Postmark for sending out HTML emails. We wanted to have a way to backup our <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> email templates automatically, so we coded a simple Github Actions workflow which is available on our Github.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is about 10 minutes of setup for you to do, and it works well enough to backup your Postmark templates and server information on a schedule.</p>
<p>Basically, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit our <a href="https://github.com/eSolia/postmark-backup">postmark-backup</a> repo on Github.</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Use this template&rdquo; to copy the repo to your own account where you can set your repo&rsquo;s visibility.</li>
<li>Make a couple of adjustments to the workflow yaml file.</li>
<li>Add some repository secrets to reference your Postmark account and server tokens as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s setup, it&rsquo;s basically set and forget, and will backup on a schedule, or when you push.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you are hosting your app on a service like the recently-closed Webfaction, you might be getting shared space for your web pages or app, databases and email addresses that can be used for sending or receiving. However, many modern hosting environments such as <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a> , Netlify or others, don&rsquo;t come with email capability and assume you&rsquo;ll setup some service to handle the emails that are issued from your app, such as welcome messages, password resets and the like, or, inbound emails. Here’s a couple that I find useful.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are plenty of email services out there, and I&rsquo;ve used many of them. There are two I started using recently, which have good UX, and hit the spot in terms of features.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of setup in either case, and you need to be able to set up your DNS, but both services I mention below have good documentation and support.</p>
<h2 id="inbound-email-via-improvmx">Inbound Email via ImprovMX</h2>
<p><a href="https://improvmx.com/">ImprovMX</a> is about forwarding inbound email in a flexible way. You could use it if your client wants to enable their website domain for email, say for a <code>hello@theirsite.com</code> address, forwarding to a distribution list at their usual corporate email system.</p>
<p>It also lets you forward json generated from the parts of an inbound email message, to a webhook, so that you could handle that programmatically.</p>
<p>We use it to forward the emails on our contracts. For example, if we have our support desk ticketing email setup so that an email address looks like <code>acme-support@ourco.net</code>, and we want to forward to <code>ticket-acme@mail2db.ourco.jp</code> and <code>support-acme@ourco.co.jp</code>, we can set up a rule that forwards:</p>
<pre><code>([a-z]+)-support@ourco.net
</code></pre>
<p>&hellip;to:</p>
<pre><code>ticket-$1@mail2db.ourco.jp, support-$1@ourco.co.jp
</code></pre>
<p>The regex in the parenthesis gets captured, and substituted into the <code>$1</code> variable. Easy.</p>
<p>Also, you may have situations where the client wants to send out as <code>hello@ourco.net</code>, and ImprovMX makes it trivial to set up an SMTP login to use for this. There should be a way to make it work in most modern email client software.</p>
<h2 id="outbound-email-via-postmark">Outbound Email via Postmark</h2>
<p>For outbound email, consider <a href="https://postmarkapp.com">Postmark</a>. It supports the usual <em>transactional</em> emails (emails to a single To: address) such as welcome messages, password resets or invoices, as well as what they call <em>broadcast</em> emails such as announcements or ToS updates.</p>
<p>What I really like about Postmark is how easy it is to craft an HTML email template to use. There&rsquo;s a UI for this, and if you&rsquo;ve ever struggled with assembling HTML email, you will know the value of something that just works. It&rsquo;s simply not like your standard web page development. Email clients are finicky, and writing emails that will work in most places is hard. The Postmark API documentation makes it easy to test, too. You just paste in your API token, and click.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.cogley.info/img/posts/email-services-for-your-apps-1.png" alt="postmark api"></p>
<p>Postmark lets you set up an SMTP address, like ImprovMX, and so your app could take advantage of this to send, as well.</p>
<p>Postmark are conservative with who they let on their service. You have to fill out a short questionnaire about how you&rsquo;re intending to use their service, and someone will review your application. I think this posture is reasonable and good, because they can guarantee better deliverability that way.</p>
<p>You may have heard of DMARC, which lets you cut down on scammers spoofing emails from your domain? It prevents people from sending an email from <code>you@yourco.com</code> even though they don&rsquo;t have access to your email client. If a recipient or their system marks such an email as spam, it hurts the reputation of all the <em>other</em> emails being sent from your domain. DMARC is meant to help with this.</p>
<p>The problem with DMARC is, the reports are rather technical, and come in as a zip file that contains an XML file with all the details of all the problems with email on your domain. In my opinion, it&rsquo;s a non-starter for business users.</p>
<p>Postmark has a for-pay service called <a href="https://dmarcdigests.com">DMARC Digests</a>, which gets you a dashboard and action items to improve deliverability for your domain. They also provide a free version, which seems great for a personal domain. In either case you need to set up or cause to be set up SPF, DKIM and DMARC entries in your DNS.</p>
<p>ImprovMX and Postmark make my life easier, and maybe they&rsquo;ll help you too.</p>

			 <p>After updating to Apple&rsquo;s iOS 15, amongst several privacy initiatives in iCloud+, you can enable &ldquo;MPP&rdquo; or Mail Privacy Protection, that has email marketers scrambling, up in arms because it blocks those 1px &ldquo;beacon&rdquo; images used to track your opens. It’s so easy to turn on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s where to look:</p>
<p><em>Settings, Mail, Privacy Protection, Protect Mail Activity ON</em></p>
<p>What it does it pre-fetch your email contents to a proxy, blocking the trackers email marketers typically use. When macOS Monterey is released, it should be available in Mail.app.</p>
<p>As far as I understand it, MPP works only with Apple Mail for now, and I wonder if in the future Apple will open it up to 3rd party email apps.</p>
<p>You can turn off &ldquo;remote image loading&rdquo; in many web or OS email clients these days. I use <a href="https://freron.com/">MailMate</a> on macOS, which for example lets you conveniently <a href="https://manual.mailmate-app.com/preferences">block images</a>, giving you the option to download all of them, or just the ones not &ldquo;strictly blocked&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632269428186/YGq3NTkmA.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>It means you can have the intended visual experience, but opt out of the tracking image.</p>

Penguins are skillful swimmers, passing in and around obstacles with ease, so that’s why the &ldquo;Suica Penguin&rdquo; was born. Its designer is the lovely <a href="http://www.sakazakichiharu.com/about.html">Chiharu Sakazaki </a><a href="http://www.sakazakichiharu.com/about.html">坂崎千春</a>, who modeled it after an Adélie penguin.

It was originally showing my avatar, then after I enabled Twitter/Medium xposting, it broke (not sure if that&rsquo;s causal).

			 <p><em>2022 update: A blast from the past. We have been living in our new house for a month, and the three cats the neighbor who died had been feeding, are now visiting us in expectation. It made me think of this post.</em></p>
<p>At the Waseda University &ldquo;Wasesai&rdquo; festival on 4th Nov 2018, Akiko and I visited some club displays in the classrooms, to kill some time before our daughter&rsquo;s concerts. One interesting one was the &ldquo;Waseneko&rdquo; circle. Here&rsquo;s why it was cool:</p>
<p>The Wasesai festival is a pretty massive and crowded affair, that takes place over a weekend in early Nov each year. It&rsquo;s an open campus, and you can tour the various halls and classrooms, to see what the University clubs or &ldquo;circles&rdquo; do. There are all kinds of clubs, and we saw a few, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the origami club (you did <em>what</em> with a single piece of paper!?)</li>
<li>the illumination club (um, LED light displays in a darkened room)</li>
<li>the train club (members visited all over and reported on their train experiences).
<ul>
<li><strong>spoiler alert</strong> - Japan&rsquo;s trains are still really, really great.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The origami art was unbelievable, and the stories from the train club were pretty cool too. Did you know that Taiwan has a couple train stations with the same names as the ones in Japan?</p>
<p>Anyway, besides our daughter&rsquo;s concerts, which were great (Reggae! Funk! Calypso!), and the above circles we saw by just wandering, I liked what the &ldquo;Waseneko&rdquo; club does. &ldquo;Waseneko&rdquo; is a portmanteau of Waseda and the Japanese word for cat, &ldquo;neko&rdquo;. There are some stray cats in the Waseda area, and the idea is to make the strays what we call in Japanese &ldquo;chiiki neko&rdquo; or &ldquo;area cats&rdquo;, that are taken care of by the residents of an area.</p>
<p>Waseneko circle was founded in 1999, almost 20 years ago, and its ~70 members have a goal of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>An environment and society where people and cats can live together</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Waseneko members collect donations and perform &ldquo;TNR&rdquo; (trap, neuter, release), then take care of the area cats, and their living spaces. The hope is, that TNR will help reduce the noise from cats in heat, and sanitation problems.</p>
<p>At the festival, they were selling postcards and other things, so we bought a few (proceeds go to food, the sign said), shown in the picture below. I don&rsquo;t <em>think</em> the cat is indeed on fire, but it&rsquo;s a kind of funny aura, if you think of how cats generally are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much info on their Japanese web page to summarize, but one page that&rsquo;s easy to understand if you don&rsquo;t speak japanese is the &ldquo;<a href="http://waseneko.wp.xdomain.jp/page-1356/">cat map</a>&rdquo; page. The dark blue dot was &ldquo;Putin&rdquo; (!) who has died (RIP) but whose hood was the north gate area.</p>
<p>(Update 2023: looks like the cat map is no longer)</p>
<p>So maybe if you visit the Waseda campus, you might spy &ldquo;Chacha&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gyoza&rdquo;, who hang out near buildings 1 and 2 respectively.</p>

			 <p>An idiot 19-year-old tourist from America was <a href="http://www.ntv.co.jp/englishnews/society/19-year-old_us_tourist_arrested_for_vandalizing_shutters/">caught vandalizing store front shutters</a> in Shibuya. Apparently this kid wanted to &ldquo;make his mark&rdquo; in Japan. What a wanker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time a person, Japanese or foreign, has decided to destroy property by vandalizing - spray painting, scratching or carving graffiti, or sticking stickers. A lot of cultural sites have been defaced, by these unbelievably selfish locals and tourists. The &ldquo;<a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201805190032.html">crying bamboo forest</a>&rdquo; where people have been carving their names in bamboo trees in Kyoto&rsquo;s Arayashiyama, or people defacing the famous red torii gates at Fushimi Inari are two examples. Some graffiti is admittedly humorous as well, like the example of a Japanese woman who <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/15/national/crime-legal/woman-held-osaka-allegedly-turning-traffic-signs-street-art/">altered street signs</a> in a funny way. Still, it could be dangerous for drivers, for obvious reasons, so I&rsquo;m still against it.</p>
<p>There are a series of laws that cover the sort of vandalism that graffiti is, from a misdemeanor to a serious crime with up to 5 years in prison and large fines, not to mention having to pay for repairs. Vandals should just stay the hell away from Japan, but if you do come and get arrested for your vandalism, you&rsquo;ll quickly find out that there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;due process&rdquo; in Japan. Seriously: Google it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of graffiti in certain parts of Tokyo and Yokohama, which I&rsquo;ve seen first hand, and apparently in other cities like Osaka or Kyoto. There are tagger gangs, like &ldquo;246&rdquo; in Tokyo and Yokohama, who go around tagging everything in certain areas. Maybe certain street art is well done, but mostly to me, it just looks dirty, and I would be royally pissed if some kid was painting my store front. I think cities should designate graffiti-ok zones, and tell people they can tag to their hearts&rsquo; content, giving them an outlet. Among the expected 40 million tourists during 2020 for the Tokyo Olympics, there&rsquo;s going to be people who think it&rsquo;s ok to vandalize. Make a kind of &ldquo;DMZ&rdquo; and let people tag away. Maybe even sell the paint, to make a little profit on it.</p>
<p>The Tendenan (単伝庵) temple in Kyoto, aka &ldquo;Rakugaki-dera&rdquo;, has a graffiti zone where they encourage visitors to write on the wall. It&rsquo;s smart. They paint over the wall every so often, and it lets people get that stuff out of their system. There&rsquo;s even a tradition of putting stickers on shrine gates, called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senjafuda">senjafuda</a>&rdquo;, so maybe those stickers look like something random to visitors, so they kind of &ldquo;join in&rdquo; in their own way. Who knows.</p>
<p>A personal example: kids like to draw, so when ours were little, we bought chalk and let them and their friends go to town on the concrete retaining wall at our house. It washes off, so no problem. But our message to them was clear: &ldquo;only here can you do this; don&rsquo;t deface your school or anything around the neighborhood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond me, how someone justifies painting on someone&rsquo;s building or store front, so my recommendation is to use the outlet for writing what you want, at most shrines in Japan: the votive &ldquo;ema&rdquo; tablet.</p>
<p>Buy an ema, write your wishes or whatever, hang it up and Instagram that thing. Nobody has to pay for your idiocy, the shrine you&rsquo;re at gets a little SNS attention and maybe, you get some good karma from the gods at that shrine.</p>

			 <p>Well of <em>course</em> Japan isn&rsquo;t going to live up to its Health Ministry&rsquo;s promises to &ldquo;ban indoor smoking&rdquo; on the ramp up to the 2020 Olympics. Ah, I need to rant a little:</p>
<p>Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, or &ldquo;MHLW&rdquo;, was selling some big promises (tall tales?) during the run-up to the decision to host the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, about &ldquo;creating a smoke-free environment&rdquo;. As a long-term non-smoking resident of Japan, I was (admittedly naïvely) hoping it would happen, but I read in the Japan Times that the Tobacco lobby has won a lot of concessions in the &ldquo;secondhand smoke&rdquo; amendment being discussed now. Search for Japan Tobacco acquisitions and you&rsquo;ll find that JT is healthy enough to buy various companies, too, so I don&rsquo;t imagine they are suffering.</p>
<p>So all this was kind of on my mind when the other day, I arrived at my usual barber, and was disappointed to realize that they had an ashtray in the waiting area. I&rsquo;d never even seen it before, but, some customer had been sitting there chain-smoking, judging by the butts piled in the ashtray, and the whole place reeked of this guy&rsquo;s cheap smokes. Eyes burning, that acrid stench stayed with me the whole time in the chair.</p>
<p>Fuck yes, secondhand smoke is real.</p>
<p>Alright. Things have improved since I arrived here in 1987, it&rsquo;s true. Some wards in Tokyo and Yokohama have ordinances about no smoking or butt-tossing in the streets, and indeed most lunch spots are non-smoking during lunchtime business hours, at least.</p>
<p>I remember a few times I grabbed the wrist of some smoking asshat, swinging his lit cigarette on a crowded street, to tell him to be careful. It was many, many years ago, but it feels fresh; those cigarettes are right about the level of a child&rsquo;s face, so, it&rsquo;s a genuine concern. Or, it <em>should</em> be a concern for a thoughtful, unselfish adult.</p>
<p>Around where I work, despite ordinances and signs, I still see Japanese people puffing away while walking and chatting, pretty much daily, sometimes even loitering right under the signs about the ordinance. Tells ya something about ordinances, right?</p>
<p>It was more than ironic, then, when I saw the below scene I snapped near a hotel near my office. Got news for you, duct-tape-loving building-owner-san, it&rsquo;s not foreigners who are the ones with bad manners about smoking and loitering.</p>
<p>In the end, I guess smokers simply don&rsquo;t have the common sense to imagine that other people might find their nasty habit distasteful or just bad-smelling.</p>
<p>The expected influx of foreign visitors for the 2020 Olympics is going to be interesting. Visitors, if you&rsquo;re a non-smoker, I urge you to contact your hotel about non-smoking restaurants in its area, before you come. Please take the action to apply pressure and don&rsquo;t take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer, so the hotels might hopefully transfer some of your pressure to local businesses. Come on! We can do it!</p>

I hear that when Japanese go to other countries and hang their laundry out, it’s often complained about.
What’s the status in your country? Do people hang out laundry?</p>

			 <p>#Anpanman playground equipment in #Yokohama #Japan. Anpanman is a superhero, who lets the weak or hungry eat part of his bean-jam-bun (anpan) head when they call him (he has great hearing and can hear anyone in the world), and can deliver a mighty an-punch or an-kick to his mortal enemy “baikin man” (bacteria man). The creator came up with Anpanman, apparently after starving in WWII and dreaming of bean jam buns.
Anpanman’s weakness? Water or moistness. When his head gets wet, he gets weak. But never fear, Uncle Jam will bake him a new head in no time.
We watched this show so many times with our daughters that I can sing the songs by heart.</p>

<p>A neat aspect is all the signs, saying what kind of fish is available and that it’s “direct from Misaki” which is the tip of the Miura Peninsula near where the Yokosuka military base is. Also, to the front right, you can get raw oysters and “OK to eat them standing right here!” I think I’ll try it next time.</p>

			 <p>Totsuka high school had their school matsuri festival (called gakusai or bunkasai 学祭、文化祭), with this pretty “washi” papered entrance prepared especially for the day. Kids put on skits and do activities all day, and it’s attended by alums, parents, teachers, friends. The ones our girls did at their school were always a lot of fun. The character you can see on the gate looks like “wa” (和), or peace/harmony. It’s kind of meta, with the right part of the character morphing into a circle, also a symbol for harmony and togetherness. #hope</p>

			 <p>So sad: virtuoso guitarist Allan Holdsworth unexpectedly died at 70 on 16th April 2017, and I wager he&rsquo;s in heaven jamming with Coltrane, maybe having a nice brew after, with a perfect head.</p>
<p>There are not many musicians who can carve out a niche like Holdsworth did, but carve he did. Odd in both meter and harmonic sense, Holdsworth&rsquo;s genius music is an aural and intellectual feast, which defies pigeon-holing. Was it fusion? Jazz? Or just &ldquo;Holdsworthian&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have a little anecdote. I did a couple sessions with a band here in Japan, whose leader decided we should play &ldquo;Letters of Marque&rdquo;, one of my absolute favorite tunes. I wrote out some notes about the tune so I could remember the changes and number of measures and so on, and after a hard-hitting sweaty run of this tune, the bass player remarked: &ldquo;nice, you actually counted that out exactly.&rdquo; It made me smile, and I remember the comment even 20-odd years later. Don&rsquo;t mess with perfection.</p>
<p>Speaking of, it’s so hard on guitar that you can’t easily get someone to cover it, so, the band leader was playing the AH parts on synth. A wild ride for sure.</p>
<p>His music and style was decidedly anti-pop, and most people probably wouldn&rsquo;t like it, but I&rsquo;m in that apparent weird minority of people who enjoy this sort of thing. Maybe you&rsquo;ll like it too:</p>

			 <p>By now you&rsquo;ve probably heard about the awful treatment by United Airlines of a man who refused to give up his seat. It was frankly brutal.</p>
<p>The situation was a result of United&rsquo;s cock-up. Apparently, they overbooked the flight, and needed space for transiting crew. After asking and trying to provide vouchers, there were no takers. So they announced that a computer would select, then they had hired goons forcibly remove the selectees. The video that went viral shows the passenger getting yanked off the plan, dragged down the aisle. It&rsquo;s unbelievable, like something out of a movie.</p>
<p>So, instead of doing the logical thing and paying for some other transportation for the transiting crew, United took a giant dump on their customers generally, and assaulted a man who refused to accommodate their screw-up like he committed some heinous crime. Then their CEO came out with this tone-deaf statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who actually talks like that. I hope the victim &ldquo;re-accommodates&rdquo; United by bringing a law suit, big time.</p>
<p>If this &ldquo;re-accommodation&rdquo; is how United treats customers who did not do anything wrong, I&rsquo;d hate to see what happens to the dude who actually does. But isn&rsquo;t this kind of bad behavior becoming endemic now, in the US? That is, &ldquo;do as you&rsquo;re told, or face the severest consequences.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Holy serif! Google and Adobe have released &ldquo;Noto Serif CJK&rdquo; aka &ldquo;Source Han Serif&rdquo;, part of an ambitious and important project to design a set of typefaces to cover the world’s languages.</p>
<p>These two are the same typeface, and they are focused on Chinese, Japanese and Korean (hence the &ldquo;CJK&rdquo; in the name). The &ldquo;Noto&rdquo; in the name Google uses comes from &ldquo;no tofu&rdquo;, and &ldquo;tofu&rdquo; describes little squares that people sometimes see when their chosen font does not have the characters in the text. It&rsquo;s a common problem; with apologies to the actual food.</p>
<p>We have had the &ldquo;Sans Serif&rdquo; version of this typeface for a few years now, and now the &ldquo;Serif&rdquo; version is available. That&rsquo;s great. The &ldquo;Sans Serif&rdquo; is the &ldquo;blockier&rdquo; version, also often known as &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; in Japan. For the &ldquo;Serif&rdquo;, they added the traditional flourishes at the ends of the lines in the characters, representing brush marks. &ldquo;Serif&rdquo; fonts are often known as &ldquo;Mincho&rdquo; in Japan.</p>
<p>What I really love about these typefaces is, they include English characters that balance well with the CJK characters. This is a bigger deal than it seems. Used to be, when you&rsquo;d type in English using a Japanese font like &ldquo;MS Mincho&rdquo;, the resulting English was just unbalanced and awful-looking. Not the case with these.</p>
<p>Thank you Google, Adobe and the other participating organizations. This is a fantastic win for computer users in Asia.</p>

			 <p>Foreign residents often hear that &ldquo;only Japan has four seasons&rdquo; and while that is of course not true, Japan does take its seasons seriously, marking them with seasonal words called &ldquo;kigo&rdquo; 季語.</p>
<p>Spring, <em>haru</em>, in Japan is traditionally Feb through May, and it’s a favorite, hopeful time of year. We have celebrated <em>hinamatsuri</em>, the girl&rsquo;s festival, since our daughters were little, and every year we can hear the lovely call of the <em>uguisu</em>, the Japanese Bush Warbler, in our garden. We have an <em>momo</em>, peach tree, and <em>sakura</em> nearby. It&rsquo;s a great time of year, except for the cedar pollen!</p>
<p>All of these things are what the <em>haiku</em> poets call <em>kigo</em> - symbols of the season. If you&rsquo;re savvy to them, you can pickup the signs when you&rsquo;re reading up on your Basho, learning tea ceremony or flower arrangement, or watching old Ozu flicks or even Studio Ghibli animated films.</p>
<p>The difference between Japan and other countries in terms of seasons, is how Japan emphasizes and codifies them and pays attention to them. You can choose to feel negative about the incessant ice-breaker type statements, or you can take the opportunity to educate a bit, showing someone what the difference actually is. The emphasis on an array of &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; for the seasons - the <em>kigo</em> - <em>is</em> actually something unique about Japanese culture, and quite interesting when you know them.</p>
<p>Can you feel the <em>haruichiban</em> blowing? I can.</p>

			 <p>Our oldest got her first full time job last year, and it finally started (things start in April in Japan). It&rsquo;s a new chapter for her and for us.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s school, a fiscal year, or work, in Japan, it usually starts in April. It makes sense. It&rsquo;s time for renewals and Spring (at least in the northern hemisphere).</p>
<p>My wife and I are watching what she is going through with some nostalgia and chagrin, since she&rsquo;s on with a new stage of life. A lot of new experiences for her; a lot of remembrances for us.</p>
<p>So for now, we steward our youngest daughter through college and into her own independent life, and watch with warm eyes as our oldest embarks on adulthood (gulp, I still can&rsquo;t imagine it!)</p>
<p>Good luck, K!</p>
