That had to sting.\n\nThe subsequent investigation showed that leaked information included review documents for applicants, emails and addresses variously of staff, applicants and certification holder companies. \n\nIt’s obviously a grave situation for a standards organization to be caught with their proverbial pants down like this, but to JIPDEC’s credit they are showing how seriously they are taking it by banning reviewers from using personal devices for performing reviews. At least it’s a step in the right direction. \n\n_Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?_ In the case of JIPDEC, I guess their customers do. I wish them well while they, um, re-apply for their own P-Mark cert. 😅\n\n![JIPDEC PrivacyMark logo and marketing blurb. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/en-01-pc.jpg)\n\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.indexnow.org/documentation\">IndexNow</a>&rdquo; is an automatic way to get participating search engines to come search specified URLs your site, and one cool thing about it is if you submit an URL to one, it gets pushed to all.

				"title": "AshidaVox ST-31-02 Headphones - new wired model for my daily driver",
				"content_html": "<p>Perhaps ten years ago I bought BeyerDynamic T90 headphones, which I love and which have served me well <em>every single day</em>, but they are just falling apart from wear<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, so I was looking for an appropriate replacement. I found new &lsquo;phones from <a href=\"https://ashidavox.com/\">AshidaVox</a><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> with great cost performance that I’ll share in this review from my perspective as an audio layperson. 🎧</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-5248.jpg\" alt=\"Wired Headphones from AshidaVox sitting on a tenugui cloth. \"></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"background-and-decision-making\">Background and Decision-making</h3>\n<p>I’m attracted to wireless headphones and IEMs that connect via Bluetooth, but I have not had good luck with reliability so far, with AirPods or wireless IEM’s of any flavor, so I thought I would look for something good which is also a <em>wired</em> model, for listening to music, podcasts and watching Netflix etc around the home. Maybe I&rsquo;m just old, but it’s less annoying to not have to recharge anyway.</p>\n<p>I prefer to support the local economy if I can, because I live and work in Japan, so for this purchase I decided to try to find made-in-Japan headphones, and go with a wired model. Researching here and there <em>e.g.</em> on the <a href=\"https://e-earphone.jp/\">e-earphone</a> site, I learned about <a href=\"https://tagostudio.com/headphones/\">Tago Studio</a> and <a href=\"https://ashidavox.com/\">AshidaVox</a>; two domestic makers of headphones. Tago is recently well regarded overseas, while AshidaVox is well known for its famous ST-31 model especially<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>I’m no expert, but the models from Tago Studio, aside from being more expensive than AshidaVox, are apparently tuned for work in a music studio by pros who work in a music studio. I gather that you want separate headphones for that kind of work, as opposed to simply listening to music for pleasure. The higher end Tago’s were raved about on English-speaking sites, for example, and they cost about JPY 65,000. This isn’t that expensive in headphone land, where some really high end headphones sell for 300 to 600K, but it’s 3x the price of the AshidaVox.</p>\n<h4 id=\"on-ashidavox\">On AshidaVox</h4>\n<p>Paraphrasing their <a href=\"https://www.ashida.co.jp/en/company/index.html\">website</a>, Ashida Onkyo (&ldquo;Sound&rdquo;) was founded in 1924 (Taisho 13) from the original Ashida Company, the general agent of Magnavox for the Far East region, and switched from importing speakers from the US to producing them domestically, when US-Japan relations deteriorated in 1942. The brand &ldquo;AshidaVox&rdquo; has been in use from 1925 until today, representing quality audio speakers and headphones, for almost 100 years!</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciding-on-the-ashidavox-st-31-02\">Deciding on the AshidaVox ST-31-02</h3>\n<p>The <strong>AshidaVox ST-31-02</strong> model that I ended up getting, was released on 1st Oct 2023, and cost about JPY 22,000 before tax (with ST-31-02 replacement ear pads available for JPY 2,090). They made <em>only 200 units</em> to start. I read some reports before my purchase that they were great cost-performance, tuned to sound good with various types of music, and despite being &ldquo;closed back&rdquo; type, they have a good &ldquo;sound stage&rdquo;, so, that sounded good enough for me given the low price.</p>\n<p>E-earphone’s <a href=\"https://e-earphone.blog/?p=1477396\">blog</a> states (as does AshidaVox’s product release blurb) that the ST-31-02 is the second generation of the famous ST-31 used in many recording studios in the &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s. Paraphrasing, they explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The speaker cone paper that was the heart of the sound was no longer made, so the original model eventually went out of production. However due to a passionate user base, AshidaVox re-released this updated version for general music appreciation purposes. They developed a special Φ 50 mm speaker driver, and while keeping the original flavor of the ST-31, they made the bass deeper and the highs more comfortable, while controlling some unpleasant resonances, giving the product a clear sound signature without muddiness. They are made one by one in Japan with a craftsman’s dexterity and sincerity, without affect, and to a consistently high level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The BeyerDynamic T90 headphones I have been using are &ldquo;open back&rdquo; which means they leak sound and might not be appropriate for night use at home or any public use, but, a lot of people like the &ldquo;open&rdquo; design, because it sounds bigger or more airy. The AshidaVox ST-31-02 model is closed, so there is a lot less sound leakage which is probably better for my living situation. If I can get my T90’s repaired I’ll compare.</p>\n<p>One criticism I read about the ST-31-02 is that the cord is short, at 1.5m, but, for my usage this is just right. The shortness is a plus for me. The T90 has a 3m cord and it gets tangled up into a weighty mass of excess cable.

				"content_text": "Perhaps ten years ago I bought BeyerDynamic T90 headphones, which I love and which have served me well _every single day_, but they are just falling apart from wear[^1], so I was looking for an appropriate replacement. I found new 'phones from [AshidaVox](https://ashidavox.com/)[^5] with great cost performance that I’ll share in this review from my perspective as an audio layperson. 🎧\n\n![Wired Headphones from AshidaVox sitting on a tenugui cloth. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-5248.jpg)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Background and Decision-making\nI’m attracted to wireless headphones and IEMs that connect via Bluetooth, but I have not had good luck with reliability so far, with AirPods or wireless IEM’s of any flavor, so I thought I would look for something good which is also a _wired_ model, for listening to music, podcasts and watching Netflix etc around the home. Maybe I'm just old, but it’s less annoying to not have to recharge anyway. \n\nI prefer to support the local economy if I can, because I live and work in Japan, so for this purchase I decided to try to find made-in-Japan headphones, and go with a wired model. Researching here and there _e.g._ on the [e-earphone](https://e-earphone.jp/) site, I learned about [Tago Studio](https://tagostudio.com/headphones/) and [AshidaVox](https://ashidavox.com/); two domestic makers of headphones. Tago is recently well regarded overseas, while AshidaVox is well known for its famous ST-31 model especially[^4]. \n\nI’m no expert, but the models from Tago Studio, aside from being more expensive than AshidaVox, are apparently tuned for work in a music studio by pros who work in a music studio. I gather that you want separate headphones for that kind of work, as opposed to simply listening to music for pleasure. The higher end Tago’s were raved about on English-speaking sites, for example, and they cost about JPY 65,000. This isn’t that expensive in headphone land, where some really high end headphones sell for 300 to 600K, but it’s 3x the price of the AshidaVox. \n\n#### On AshidaVox\nParaphrasing their [website](https://www.ashida.co.jp/en/company/index.html), Ashida Onkyo (\"Sound\") was founded in 1924 (Taisho 13) from the original Ashida Company, the general agent of Magnavox for the Far East region, and switched from importing speakers from the US to producing them domestically, when US-Japan relations deteriorated in 1942. The brand \"AshidaVox\" has been in use from 1925 until today, representing quality audio speakers and headphones, for almost 100 years! \n\n### Deciding on the AshidaVox ST-31-02\nThe **AshidaVox ST-31-02** model that I ended up getting, was released on 1st Oct 2023, and cost about JPY 22,000 before tax (with ST-31-02 replacement ear pads available for JPY 2,090). They made _only 200 units_ to start. I read some reports before my purchase that they were great cost-performance, tuned to sound good with various types of music, and despite being \"closed back\" type, they have a good \"sound stage\", so, that sounded good enough for me given the low price. \n\nE-earphone’s [blog](https://e-earphone.blog/?p=1477396) states (as does AshidaVox’s product release blurb) that the ST-31-02 is the second generation of the famous ST-31 used in many recording studios in the '80s and '90s. Paraphrasing, they explain: \n\n> The speaker cone paper that was the heart of the sound was no longer made, so the original model eventually went out of production. However due to a passionate user base, AshidaVox re-released this updated version for general music appreciation purposes. They developed a special Φ 50 mm speaker driver, and while keeping the original flavor of the ST-31, they made the bass deeper and the highs more comfortable, while controlling some unpleasant resonances, giving the product a clear sound signature without muddiness. They are made one by one in Japan with a craftsman’s dexterity and sincerity, without affect, and to a consistently high level. \n\nThe BeyerDynamic T90 headphones I have been using are \"open back\" which means they leak sound and might not be appropriate for night use at home or any public use, but, a lot of people like the \"open\" design, because it sounds bigger or more airy. The AshidaVox ST-31-02 model is closed, so there is a lot less sound leakage which is probably better for my living situation. If I can get my T90’s repaired I’ll compare. \n\nOne criticism I read about the ST-31-02 is that the cord is short, at 1.5m, but, for my usage this is just right. The shortness is a plus for me. The T90 has a 3m cord and it gets tangled up into a weighty mass of excess cable. If I add a USB DAC in-line for a little boost, that adds just a bit of length as well. \n\nIn addition, the ST-31-02’s low impedance of `26Ω` means I can drive them directly from an iPhone or iPad. In comparison, the T90s have an impedance of `250Ω`, meaning you really need to put them through an amp so they will sound good. \n\nAll that said, I decided on the ST-31-02’s because they fit my usage and come from a reputable maker, and in my opinion, they sound great! \n\n### Usage\nThe purpose of these headphones is to use them around the house for listening to relaxing music during work, or listening to podcasts or lectures, and watching some streaming service videos before bed. I’m certainly not so knowledgeable about audio, and just want headphones to sound \"good enough\", so I experimented with some settings for my usage pattern.\n\nIf you are interested in testing for yourself, you can copy the settings I made in iPhone and iPad iOS 17.1: \n\n* _Settings, Music, Audio section_\n\t* **Dolby Atmos** - always on[^2]\n\t* **Lossless** - on for Wi-Fi streaming\n\t* **EQ** - various, change to suit the music\n\nBesides the above settings, I tried the ST-31-02’s with and without an amp and they sounded good either way.[^3] Changing the above mentioned EQ setting really helps as well. \n\nThe look and feel is quality, but has a sort of retro feel. If \"modern\" is slick CNC’ed smoothness, then these look more like a craftsman made them, and maybe they are just a touch old fashioned. The cups look like painted fiberglass, and you get the feeling they would be right at home in a factory or a school. Personally I’m kind of \"Showa\" anyway, and I really like it. They feel solid in the hands and snug when worn. \n\n### Specifications\nHere’s the maker specs, translation mistakes mine: \n\n<table>\n\t<caption>Specification for ST-31-02 from Maker Instruction Sheet</caption>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>\n\t\t\t\tAspect\n\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t<th>\n\t\t\t\tSpecification\n\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tType\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tClosed back dynamic\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tDriver Diameter\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tΦ 50 mm\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tImpedance\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t26Ω (at 1 kHz/mW)\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tSensitivity\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t104 dB/mW\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tMax Input Power\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t1000 mW (IEC)\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tFrequency Response\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t7-70000 Hz\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tCord Length\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t~1.5 m\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tConnector and Cable\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tΦ 3.5 mm gold plated stereo plug, fixed non-swap cable\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tWeight\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t~250 g including cord\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tIncluded\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tInstruction sheet, Φ6.3mm Adapter Plug (screw on)\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\nBy comparison the T90 headphones have an impedance of `250Ω` meaning they work better with an amp, a sensitivity of `102 dB`, and a frequency response of `5-40,000 Hz`. \n\nSo far I really like these AshidaVox headphones and am satisfied about the purchase.

Yoshimitsu is said to have prayed to the Bodhisatva (Daibosatsu) Hachiman <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> to give thanks for saving his life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h3>\n<p>We left Yokohama just before 5am in the dark, but the two hour drive according to Google Maps took three, and when we arrived around 8am, parking lots 1, 2, and 3 were full, and we were directed to lot 4 down by the lake. Fortunately there was a &ldquo;porta-potty&rdquo; style toilet in the lot, so we used that and headed up road and trail to get to the trail head proper.</p>\n<p>The hike started in quite an idyllic fashion, walking on a groomed trail with a gentle slope, over wooden deck structures through a lovely forest with bird song and the &ldquo;waka waka&rdquo; call of squirrels. We noticed our cell signals were quite weak here, and could not start our Yamap apps to record at first. It eventually worked as we walked along.</p>\n<p>In fifteen minutes or so, we arrived at Lodge Chobei<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> (<a href=\"http://www.choubei.info/\">ロッジ長兵衛</a>), where the parking lot we’d wanted to use was. Here, we bought Daibosatsurei badges for our collection, and proceeded on our way, but they have food and other souvenirs as well. There’s also a public toilet nearby, which I marked on my <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1MVXMB1gmaA-UywbQtQVnfh7Gnc5pZ4w&amp;usp=sharing\">annotated map</a>.</p>\n<p>The trailhead is &ldquo;Kami-hikawa Touge&rdquo; (上日川峠), &ldquo;touge&rdquo; being mountain pass. This is the name used for the first part of the north-east-bound route up Daibosatsurei, for three (free) parking lots nearby, for the bus stop, and for the dam down near where we parked. Triers should note, the trail head is about 19 or 20km from Chuo Expressway Katsunuma IC by car on a narrow winding road, or by the number 14 bus bound for Kamihikawa Touge, from JR Chuo Kai-Yamato station. It’s an hour whether you’re driving or taking the bus.</p>\n<p>From the trailhead, it’s not far to &ldquo;Fukuchan-sou&rdquo; (副ちゃん荘, where &ldquo;sou&rdquo; indicates lodging), and the hike is similar to the first part - easy going, on packed dirt with leaves, pine needles, and some roots. Fukuchan-sou also has food and souvenirs, and a plaque on the outside of the facility states that the (at that time in 2002) Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako rested here during their hike up to Daibosatsurei. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Kyuya Fukada’s &ldquo;100 mountains&rdquo; book gained popularity because the (now) Emperor mentioned enjoying it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"our-route-up-karamatsu-ridge\">Our Route Up: Karamatsu Ridge</h3>\n<p>Fukuchan-sou marks what’s called the &ldquo;Karamatsu-one&rdquo; (唐松尾根, where &ldquo;one&rdquo; is ridge) Junction, where there’s a public toilet, and where you can elect to go up to the summit clock-wise via Karamatsu Ridge or counter-clockwise via Daibosatsu Pass. After a brief rest and use of the facilities, we turned left here and went up Karamatsu Ridge, because the views are probably better that way and you tax your legs on the steeper part, while they are fresh, and have a more gentle descent.</p>\n<p>One thing we noticed is, from right around Fukuchan-sou, the trail gradually turns gravelly, then it changes to a bed of small rocks, which continues pretty much the whole way. I saw a couple people wearing regular sneakers, but you’re going to end up with pretty bruised feet if you do that. Proper hiking boots are recommended on this hike.</p>\n<p>The Karamatsu ridge route gets steeper as you go along, and there were a couple spots where I needed to use my hands for stability as I clambered up, and some areas that were simply just crowded with people in what felt like a queue, but there was nothing that was overly risky. A couple people even brought their dogs (even a French bulldog in a halloween costume).</p>\n<h3 id=\"lunch-at-lightning-rock--daibosatsurei-summit\">Lunch at Lightning Rock &amp; Daibosatsurei Summit</h3>\n<p>Eventually you get to what <em>looks</em> like the summit, but it’s actually the &ldquo;Rai-iwa&rdquo; (雷岩 lightning rock). This is where we stopped for lunch.</p>\n<p>Due to the crowds, there weren’t really any smooth rocks to sit on, so we got our sit pads out (recommended!) and made do, boiling some water for instant soup. Rice balls and soup were quaffed while we took in the gorgeous view, and did some people watching, listening to the various languages of the tourist hikers.</p>\n<p>From the Rai-iwa, it’s a short jaunt to the summit, where the views are definitely not so great, kind of obscured by trees. A fellow trekker offered to take our photo by the summit marker, so we took him up on that. Now we earned the badges we bought at the foot of the mountain. Back at Rai-iwa, we climbed up on top of the rock crag for the wonderful view to the south, paused a few moments, then started our descent via Daibosatsu Touge (大菩薩峠).</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-descent-via-daibosatsu-touge\">The Descent via Daibosatsu Touge</h3>\n<p>Daibosatsu Touge is a &ldquo;saddle ridge&rdquo; pass extending about 2km south-southeast ward from Daibosaturei, and affords hikers just <em>stunning</em> views of the surrounding area, as well as mountains such as Kurodake, Genjirodake, and of course the famous Fuji. This day, Fuji was under a bit of cloud cover, but we got some fleeting glimpses of her mass. Part way down, the view opens up and you can see all the way to where the pass summit is marked, at Kaizan-sou lodge.</p>\n<p>Daibosatsu Touge is the name of an unfinished 41-episode serialized novel by Kaizan Nakazato (中里介山), from whom the Kaizan-sou lodge gets its name. The novel is said to be popular even today, and was published in national papers from 1913 to 1941 <sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>, telling the story of a murderous swordsman. It was given a dramatization in the eponymous 1966 film, translated as &ldquo;The Sword of Doom&rdquo; in English. Search and you’ll find a few videos on YouTube including an old trailer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sudden-weather\">Sudden Weather</h3>\n<p>During our descent, around &ldquo;Kanbe-iwa&rdquo; (神部岩)<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">5</a></sup> , K asked &ldquo;did you feel that? It’s starting to rain.&rdquo; It seemed like rain at first, and as it started to come down, it became clear it was hail. Eventually it got strong enough that we decided to layer up in rain gear, and cover our packs. The line of hikers on the trail all paused at once to do the same thing. It was odd, because we could see the sun across the valley, but were right inside this cold weather. Goes to show, you need to be ready for anything in the mountains.</p>\n<p>Just before we got to Daibosatsu Touge, the weather was already clearing up and people were coming out of an emergency shelter. Probably there was no need for it today, but it is nice to know it’s there if you need it. The name is a little disconcerting, &ldquo;Sai-no-kawara&rdquo; (さいの河原), the riverbank in Buddhist canon where Jizo Bodhisatva helps children who died too early avoid evil spirits so they can cross over.</p>\n<p>Finally we arrived at the Daibosatsu Touge 1897m elevation marker and Kaizan-sou, where you can have a break, buy some souvenirs, or use the public toilet. There are two ways down from there, one further south to Mt. Kumazawa and back, but we elected to take a hard right before the toilets, to take the shorter easterly route past Fujimi-sou (富士見荘), and back to Fukuchan-sou.</p>\n<h3 id=\"finishing-up\">Finishing up</h3>\n<p>There are some steep areas on the way down, but nothing too hard, and it really gets easier and easier as you get closer to the junction at Fukuchan-sou, with some lovely autumn colors and scenes. From there, it was an easy hike back to the parking lot, where we worried it was going to be impossible to get out, due to how people had randomly parked. We were one of the first cars in lot 4 in the AM, so we were waaay back in the corner of this lot.</p>\n<p>We found a day-use onsen called <a href=\"http://www.daibosatsu-kankou.com/facility/yamato_tenmoku_hotspring.php\">Yamato-tenmoku</a>, chucked it in the navi, and it was a welcome rest after our hike. It took 30 or 40 min to drive there, and we had a scrub and a soak<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">6</a></sup>, a snack, and were on our way home for a big meal.

A fantastic day, and the 6 hours of driving was well worth it. \n\n![Summit of Daibosatsurei ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-5204.jpg)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Daibosatsurei Background\n\"Daibosaturei\" is one of the \"100 Mountains of Japan\" (after Kyuya Fukada’s book), located in Yamanashi Prefecture in the [Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichibu_Tama_Kai_National_Park) (in the \"Kai\" part), straddling Koshu City and Kitatsurugun, and feeding the Tama and Fuefuki rivers.

Here, we bought Daibosatsurei badges for our collection, and proceeded on our way, but they have food and other souvenirs as well. There’s also a public toilet nearby, which I marked on my [annotated map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1MVXMB1gmaA-UywbQtQVnfh7Gnc5pZ4w&usp=sharing). \n\nThe trailhead is \"Kami-hikawa Touge\" (上日川峠), \"touge\" being mountain pass. This is the name used for the first part of the north-east-bound route up Daibosatsurei, for three (free) parking lots nearby, for the bus stop, and for the dam down near where we parked.

Thing is, he was so drunk he didn&rsquo;t even really notice, so we just said thanks, stifling disgust and laughter, brushing the vomitus off my friend&rsquo;s lapel, grabbed our shochu&rsquo;s and snacks and retreated into the station through the turnstile.</p>\n<p>When I see my client friend, we always recount the &ldquo;flying ramen vomit incident&rdquo; with gestures and SFX.

Thing is, he was so drunk he didn't even really notice, so we just said thanks, stifling disgust and laughter, brushing the vomitus off my friend's lapel, grabbed our shochu's and snacks and retreated into the station through the turnstile.\n\nWhen I see my client friend, we always recount the \"flying ramen vomit incident\" with gestures and SFX. It was an unforgettable experience. 🍜🤢\n\n---- \n_Not the same ramen:_\n\n![Photo of yarou ramen at night in Shimbashi](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/night-wander-in-shimbashi-going-home-sp212811-2.jpg \"Yaro Ramen, no relation to this story but a ramen-ya nevertheless, Photo by Rick Cogley 2017\")\n\n\n",

				"title": "Hakone Myojingatake Hike - from Saijoji to Miyagino",
				"content_html": "<p>On Sunday 3 Sept 2023, I did a 6hr solo point-to-point hike in Hakone, ascending 903m up to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_My%C5%8Djin_(Kanagawa)\">Myojingatake</a> (明神が岳, 1169m) from Daiyuzan <a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%80%E4%B9%97%E5%AF%BA\">Saijoji Temple</a> (大雄山最乗寺 aka Doryoson), and descending 719m to Miyagino (宮城野) on Rt. 138, traveling over about 9km. From there I took the bus down to Kami-to-no-sawa (上塔ノ沢), then walked to an onsen for a scrub and a soak.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/fa16ac9a-f82b-4d5a-955e-2e3f484b2baf-1724-00000192526852e7.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Hakone mountains from the top of Mt Myojin\"></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>When I <a href=\"https://cogley.jp/2023/08/19/mt-myojogatake-hiking.html\">hiked up Myojogatake</a>, I had intended to go up Myojingatake as well, but I was tired that day and opted out. In looking at various routes up today’s peak, I picked the route coming from the northeast, from the lovely and sprawling temple complex at Saijoji.</p>\n<p>As usual, I wanted to start out early to be off the mountain around noon, so I left at 4:30am, got to Odawara before 6:00am, and was at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiy%C5%ABzan_Station\">Daiyuzan</a> station, the last stop on the Izu Hakone Tetsudo line, by about 6:20am. To my surprise, the buses up to Saijoji start around 9am, so, I used the public toilet outside the station, then checked the map for how far it would be to walk to Saijoji (about 3km). Fortunately a taxi pulled in, so I took advantage and got a ride up the road. The taxi driver was talkative, regaling me with his own hiking adventures, but we arrived within 15 min.</p>\n<p>There’s two more-or-less parallel routes up Myojingatake, both proceeding in the southwest direction from Saijoji. One starts at the Saijoji entrance, off to the left immediately; the other from the back of the complex, after you pass through it. I chose to go through the temple complex and take the more north of the two routes. It was a bit tougher to find the actual trail, but Yamareco kept me on track.</p>\n<p>The temple complex is really beautiful, but there are <em>so</em> many steps. I counted about 220 or 230 steps on only the last staircase. There were plenty more before that. After you get on the trail, it’s a cedar forest for most of the way to the top along a ridgeline. The trail is packed dirt with some rocks and roots. It was misty in the early morning, and as I was marveling at the view in one spot, I heard a rustle, and turned to find a doe about 3 meters away. She regarded me, and I regarded her, as I took some snaps and a quick video, then she ran off just as soon as she had come into view. That, and the fog made the hike feel quite magical.</p>\n<p>A couple of spots during the ascent are not well marked. I mistakenly headed up a river bed at one, but realized something was off, doubled back, and went up a steeper route to the left which turned out to be right. Another spot was just open forest area where you could barely see the trail. In either case, it helped to look at the <a href=\"https://www.yamareco.com/\">Yamareco</a> app, which has a clear indicator of which direction you should be proceeding, and even lets you know if you veer off.</p>\n<p>After the long ascent, I got to what was marked as the summit on the map, but there was no placard or any kind of sign that I was in the right place, so I got a bit worried I was off track. I kept going though, and finally got to a kind of picnic area a few meters below, which had signs and explanations of what should be visible. I didn’t have luck seeing Mt. Fuji again, but I could at least see <a href=\"https://cogley.jp/2023/07/24/kintoki-hike-in.html\">Mt. Kintoki</a> in the foreground (Fuji should have been visible behind it).</p>\n<p>I took a short break at the picnic tables, then started descending, eventually merging with the same route as I took when I hiked Myojogatake a few weeks before. As I mentioned in that post, you see signs for the Miyagino Annaijo bus stop and toilet as you get close to the road. I waited a few minutes for a bus bound for Hakone Yumoto, headed down about 15 min or so, then got off at Kami-Tonosawa bus stop.

				"content_text": "On Sunday 3 Sept 2023, I did a 6hr solo point-to-point hike in Hakone, ascending 903m up to [Myojingatake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_My%C5%8Djin_(Kanagawa)) (明神が岳, 1169m) from Daiyuzan [Saijoji Temple](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%80%E4%B9%97%E5%AF%BA) (大雄山最乗寺 aka Doryoson), and descending 719m to Miyagino (宮城野) on Rt. 138, traveling over about 9km. From there I took the bus down to Kami-to-no-sawa (上塔ノ沢), then walked to an onsen for a scrub and a soak. \n\n![Photo of Hakone mountains from the top of Mt Myojin](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/fa16ac9a-f82b-4d5a-955e-2e3f484b2baf-1724-00000192526852e7.jpg)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nWhen I [hiked up Myojogatake](https://cogley.jp/2023/08/19/mt-myojogatake-hiking.html), I had intended to go up Myojingatake as well, but I was tired that day and opted out. In looking at various routes up today’s peak, I picked the route coming from the northeast, from the lovely and sprawling temple complex at Saijoji. \n\nAs usual, I wanted to start out early to be off the mountain around noon, so I left at 4:30am, got to Odawara before 6:00am, and was at [Daiyuzan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiy%C5%ABzan_Station) station, the last stop on the Izu Hakone Tetsudo line, by about 6:20am. To my surprise, the buses up to Saijoji start around 9am, so, I used the public toilet outside the station, then checked the map for how far it would be to walk to Saijoji (about 3km). Fortunately a taxi pulled in, so I took advantage and got a ride up the road. The taxi driver was talkative, regaling me with his own hiking adventures, but we arrived within 15 min. \n\nThere’s two more-or-less parallel routes up Myojingatake, both proceeding in the southwest direction from Saijoji. One starts at the Saijoji entrance, off to the left immediately; the other from the back of the complex, after you pass through it. I chose to go through the temple complex and take the more north of the two routes. It was a bit tougher to find the actual trail, but Yamareco kept me on track. \n\nThe temple complex is really beautiful, but there are _so_ many steps. I counted about 220 or 230 steps on only the last staircase. There were plenty more before that. After you get on the trail, it’s a cedar forest for most of the way to the top along a ridgeline. The trail is packed dirt with some rocks and roots. It was misty in the early morning, and as I was marveling at the view in one spot, I heard a rustle, and turned to find a doe about 3 meters away. She regarded me, and I regarded her, as I took some snaps and a quick video, then she ran off just as soon as she had come into view. That, and the fog made the hike feel quite magical. \n\nA couple of spots during the ascent are not well marked. I mistakenly headed up a river bed at one, but realized something was off, doubled back, and went up a steeper route to the left which turned out to be right. Another spot was just open forest area where you could barely see the trail. In either case, it helped to look at the [Yamareco](https://www.yamareco.com/) app, which has a clear indicator of which direction you should be proceeding, and even lets you know if you veer off. \n\nAfter the long ascent, I got to what was marked as the summit on the map, but there was no placard or any kind of sign that I was in the right place, so I got a bit worried I was off track. I kept going though, and finally got to a kind of picnic area a few meters below, which had signs and explanations of what should be visible. I didn’t have luck seeing Mt. Fuji again, but I could at least see [Mt. Kintoki](https://cogley.jp/2023/07/24/kintoki-hike-in.html) in the foreground (Fuji should have been visible behind it).\n\nI took a short break at the picnic tables, then started descending, eventually merging with the same route as I took when I hiked Myojogatake a few weeks before. As I mentioned in that post, you see signs for the Miyagino Annaijo bus stop and toilet as you get close to the road. I waited a few minutes for a bus bound for Hakone Yumoto, headed down about 15 min or so, then got off at Kami-Tonosawa bus stop. From there I walked a little bit up to [Hakone Yuryo](https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/ \"Hakone Yuryo\"), my oft-frequented day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal. \n\nHakone Yuryo runs a shuttle bus to and from Hakone Yumoto station, so I took advantage of that to get to Hakone Yumoto afterwards, then took the funicular to Odawara and took the JR train back home. \n\nA couple days after this hike, a retired police and experienced hiker friend told me they used Myojingatake for mountain training when he was in the police academy. He said that a respected older officer suddenly fell dead when they were on a training hike there one day, and that he has never forgotten that incident, burned into his young brain at the time. That was a bit chilling to hear, but it just reminds you that you need to be prepared and ready for anything in the mountains. \n\nAs always, please check out the route map on my [Yamareco activity URL](https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5897610.html), and I hope to see you on the trail some time! 🌋\n\n---- \nHere’s my assessment of this hike using the [Japan Mountain Hike Grading](https://cogley.jp/japan-mountain-hike-grading/) scales:\n\n<table>\n\t<caption>Japan Hike Grading Assessment</caption>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>\n\t\t\t\tRanking Criteria\n\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t<th>\n\t\t\t\tDetails\n\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t<th>\n\t\t\t\tLevel\n\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tStamina\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t(6×1.8) ＋ (9×0.3) ＋ (0.9×10) ＋ (0.7×0.6) ＝ 23\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tTechnical Difficulty\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tPath sometimes hard to follow,   \n\t\t\t\tSome plunge/slip risk areas\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n---- \nSee the [photo gallery](https://1drv.ms/a/s!Ag_R9efw_8fIg70F3RdbWmfx5nSWNQ?e=UfBKOd)and [Yamareco activity record](https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5897610.html). \n\n_Route map, see also on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1GS5ndbHzdv64emm_DaOxmUmH0yUOsAQ&usp=sharing):_\n\n![Map of Hakone hikes, with today’s highlighted.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/jrc-screenshot-2023-09-24-at-14.03.48.png)\n\n_Izu Hakone Tetsudo Line Train, at Odawara_: \n\n![Photo of Odawara station on the Izu Hakone Tetsudo line up to Daiyuzan](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-4844.jpg)\n\n_Bridge just inside Saijoji, heading to the trailhead I didn’t use_: \n\n![Photo of bridge in Saijoji](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/7ecd33f6-37eb-43e4-b645-05f524b0abf1-1724-00000158c3e10583.jpg)\n\n_Comically long staircase at Saijoji_: \n\n![Photo of a long staircase, Saijoji temple](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/7b972fbd-4c40-473b-b6c5-357ba36fa108-1724-00000160006323cc.jpg)\n\n_Doe friend on the trail_: \n\n![Photo of a doe on the trail to Myojingatake](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/4bb2bd94-a5c9-4088-a4bc-981144c84163-1724-00000190aec0d63d.jpg)\n\n_At the summit_: \n\n![Photo of Rick Cogley at Myojigatake summit](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/f9360c84-a756-4b2c-9330-5e415856b98b-1724-0000019a806f2605.jpg)\n\n\n",

				"title": "Old Tokaido Hike in Hakone",
				"content_html": "<p>On Monday 18 Sept 2023, on Respect-for-the-Aged day, I did a 5hr solo point-to-point hike in Hakone, up the &ldquo;old Tokaido&rdquo; and &ldquo;old Hakone Town&rdquo; roads, ascending 752m and descending 119m over 10.7km. This was not up a single mountain <em>per se</em>, but was plenty tiring going up a very long slope, as the humidity is still hanging around even in September. The hike started in Hakone Yumoto, then followed the road then trails all the way up to Lake Ashi. From there, I got the bus back toward Yumoto, stopping off part way along, to scrub off the trail dirt and have a dip in the onsen.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I got to JR Odawara a bit before 6am and was hiking at Hakone Yumoto by 6:40am, and the first 3 kilometers or so are over road, up route 732. You see Yumoto receding on the right as you ascend. Getting to rt 732 proper required some peering at the map, but once you’re on it, you just have to keep an eye out for some landmarks.</p>\n<p>After many bus stops, as you’re nearing the trailhead, you pass a rather colorful temple that reminds one of those in Nikko, the Hakone Dai-tengu, then a hotel on the right, followed by the Sukumogawa IC highway intersection. Another couple hundred meters along, and you’ll see Sagumodera Temple on the left, which has a small waterfall and a water spout for purification next to the road. The Sukumogawa Nature Trail trail head is soon after, also on the left.</p>\n<p>At the trail head, you’ll see a sign for the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.hakone-geopark.jp/area-guide/hakone1/006sekisyotoisidatami.html\">Hakone Geo-park</a>&rdquo; explaining a bit about the area, and from there, you ascend a bit then basically descend to the river, where you can cross over a narrow wooden footbridge near the Tesco power station. There is also a suspension bridge about 100m upstream, if you’re not comfortable with the &ldquo;maruta-bashi&rdquo;. It was a bit wobbly and unstable, to be honest.</p>\n<p>Once you’re over the bridge, you go up to rt 732 again near a shrine, then you’re going to proceed on the Old Tokaido or Old Hakone Town cobblestone roads. The first landmark is the rock that Goro Soga is said to have split with his sword to test its sharpness when seeking revenge, according to the sign. Some sections of the cobble paved roads are actually from the Edo period road started in c. 1603, so walking over those marked sections is a moving experience. Other cobblestone sections were destroyed during the massive &lsquo;quakes in 1923 and 1930, and were repaired after that, using the same road-making techniques.</p>\n<p>There are many signs, some with English, that explain how the roads were built. I think that Roman architects would be suitably impressed. I can’t even imagine the amount of labor that building something like these roads would require, back when there was no heavy equipment to rely on. I mean, here I am struggling to just <em>walk</em> on the trail, much less haul large rocks all day. By the way, the cobbles were slippery in parts, so some care was needed. It would be more so, after a rain.</p>\n<p>Eventually, as you proceed on and off the old Tokaido road and sometimes rt 732, you’ll get to Hatajuku, one of the old rest stops and so-called <em>ichirizuka</em> distance markers on the old Tokaido; the 23rd &ldquo;ri&rdquo; from Nihonbashi, to be exact.</p>\n<p><em>As an aside, the distance markers on the old Tokaido were one &ldquo;ri&rdquo; apart, about 4km. Nihonbashi, where the old Tokaido started, would have therefore been about 92km from Hatajuku. The meter distances on the trail were marked in old style Japanese as bei 米.</em></p>\n<p>Hatajuku is full of shops selling the famous Hakone Zaiku wooden <em>yosegi</em> marquetry, and there’s a clean public toilet that you can use before continuing up the trail.</p>\n<p>The Tokugawa Shogunate designated 53 official &ldquo;Post Stations&rdquo; where you had to show a travel permit to pass when using the Tokaido. Hatajuku was apparently <em>not</em> one of those, just a rest area, but there are the official Hakone-juku and Odawara-juku nearby. There was also the <a href=\"https://www.hakonesekisyo.jp/\">Hakone Checkpoint</a> that was a security gate, to control who left from or travelled to Edo, and you can visit a museum regarding that in present day near Ashinoko Lake, if you enjoy that history.</p>\n<p>From Hatajuku, it’s more ascending up steps and cobblestone paths, and you’ll eventually come to the famous Amazake Chaya where you can take your well-earned break. The strawberry shaved ice with real strawberry chunks was really good, as was the iced matcha, and the atmosphere of the place was just really cool. Compared to the folks who drove there, I was obviously sweating from hiking, and probably didn’t smell that great. They gave me a special &ldquo;safe travels&rdquo; paper that they give to hikers, which I really appreciated. You can see it in the photo below.</p>\n<p>After about 30 minutes’ break in the Chaya, I completed the ascent, then descended to Ashinoko. I was looking for the Hakone Tozan bus back to Yumoto and one had just arrived, so I didn’t really linger. The bus to Yumoto passes Kami-Tonosawa, where I got off so I could have a soak in the usual <a href=\"https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/\" title=\"Hakone Yuryo\">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and took the JR train back home.</p>\n<p>So, all in all I walked about 2.7 &ldquo;ri&rdquo; this day, which would have meant I passed by just two of the 128 &ldquo;ri&rdquo; distance markers on what was a 514km cobblestone road, with its 53 official overnight stations like &ldquo;Totsuka-juku&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hakone-juku&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Finally, check out the route map on my <a href=\"https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5952733.html\">Yamareco activity URL</a>, and give me a shout if you see me on the trail some time! 🌋</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here’s my assessment of this hike using the <a href=\"https://cogley.jp/japan-mountain-hike-grading/\">Japan Mountain Hike Grading</a> scales:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://1drv.ms/a/s!Ag_R9efw_8fIg78TfZeNb9TusuDHPQ?e=aukGVd\">photo gallery</a>and <a href=\"https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5952733.html\">Yamareco activity record</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Route map, see also on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1GS5ndbHzdv64emm_DaOxmUmH0yUOsAQ&amp;usp=sharing\">Google Maps</a>:</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/jrc-screenshot-2023-09-20-at-19.50.43.png\" alt=\"Map of Hakone hikes, with today’s highlighted.\"></p>\n<p><em>Beautiful river view at the start of the hike</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/1318218a-40ef-4e94-80f5-fb442d89987c-7364-00000bcda33dbd97.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of river near Hakone Yumoto\"></p>\n<p><em>Very colorful temple as you get close to the trail head</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/3a3f7300-055d-4959-8eeb-695616ec40a7-7364-00000bd939ea4501.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Hakone Dai-tengu temple gate\"></p>\n<p><em>Get pure just before the trail head</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/729bc9ae-d664-4131-9340-f08214c6bd4b-7364-00000bdd6c3e4497.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of purification pool at Sagumodera Temple just before the trail head\"></p>\n<p><em>Trailhead</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/436ab116-833b-4c6b-9b70-5f56edfdcb41-7364-00000bdefdb83a17.jpg\" alt=\"Trailhead marked by Hakone GeoPark sign\"></p>\n<p><em>Maruta-bashi across the river, keep your balance!</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/4f538884-a8e0-4a22-9653-37aab036d889-7364-00000be3f1dbd782.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of the log bridge across the river, near Tesco\"></p>\n<p><em>Alternative route a little upstream</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/f04707d7-b9ba-4394-8b39-f171e448bcaa-7364-00000be62efca1b9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Old Tokaido Cobblestones!</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/0addfc5b-edae-4fbc-830c-5faeed4d9cdf-7364-00000bf76df7a723.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of real 1602-ish cobbles on the old Tokaido!\"></p>\n<p><em>Famous Amazake Chaya shaved ice and iced matcha, with the good luck charm paper they gave me</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/9c910db2a6.jpg\" alt=\"Iced matcha and shaved ice photo, at amazake chaya\"></p>\n<p><em>How we built the road cross section diagram</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/17279129-ff38-4916-8998-41305e043d3a-7364-00000c1c7f4f8a44.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of billboard showing how to build cobblestone roads of the old Tokaido\"></p>\n<p><em>Ashinoko lake!</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/6de93eba-4c38-469b-aaa1-86f51b42f49a-7364-00000c2aea7b1b1f.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of the first place you can see the lake!\"></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>On Sunday 27 August 2023, I challenged myself to an approx 5:45hr 6.8km solo hike in the Tanzawa range on a hot and humid day (it suddenly rained at the end), ascending about 905m up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_%C5%8Cyama_(Kanagawa)\">Mt. Oyama</a> starting in the shopping district around 7am, climbing up via the &ldquo;Onna-zaka&rdquo; (women’s slope) route to the summit, then descending about 630m down via Miharashidai to the &ldquo;Shimosha&rdquo; shrine area, and finally down by cable car.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-5241.jpg\" alt=\"Pin badge from Mt. Oyama shop, showing elevation and the name in Japanese and English, depicting a shrine and deer in a forest scene.\"></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Mt. Oyama is considered holy and has significant and interesting history. It’s also known as &ldquo;Afuri Yama&rdquo;, where &ldquo;Afuri&rdquo; refers to the rainy conditions, and &ldquo;Kunimi-yama&rdquo; the Guardian of the Land. The main shrine at the top is called &ldquo;Oyama Afuri Jinja Honsha&rdquo; (大山阿夫利神社 本社), and the one at the base near the top cable car station is &ldquo;Oyama Afuri Jinja Shimosha&rdquo; (大山阿夫利神社 下社), the &ldquo;lower shrine&rdquo;. There is also &ldquo;Oyama Dera&rdquo; a Buddhist Temple at the first stop on the cable car, half way up to the lower shrine.</p>\n<p>It may be somewhat crowded and fairly &ldquo;commercialized&rdquo; but Oyama’s a challenging enough intermediate hike nevertheless. If you’re new to mountain trekking, try a smaller peak first, such as Takao or Hakone’s Kintoki, before attempting 1,252m Oyama. Indeed, and true to its &ldquo;Afuri Yama&rdquo; name, this hike was sunny until it suddenly started raining after I got down, but you should be prepared for weather, even in summer. Oyama is located in the Tanzawa-Oyama Quasi National Park in northwest Kanagawa prefecture, with over 38,000 hectares of forest with various mountain hikes, dams, rivers, waterfalls and so on, so if you want more of a challenge, you can try hikes such as To-no-dake and Mt. Tanzawa.</p>\n<p>To be more specific, it’s partially about the meters of elevation difference that make a hike easier or harder. Hikes in the Kamakura Alps are over rolling hills, 100 or 200m in height, so you get maybe +/-200 or 300m or so over the course of the hike. When you start actual &ldquo;Tozan&rdquo; (mountain climbing, where the main point is ascending a single or multiple peaks), like at Takao in Tokyo, Kintoki in Hakone, or something like Kurobi in Gunma, you are doing +/-500 or 600m. Then you start doing hikes where you’ve chosen a trail that requires +/-800 to 1000. Tanzawa’s Oyama is one such, as is Hakone’s Sengen or Myojingatake. More difficult are peaks like To-no-dake and Mt. Tanzawa, which are near Oyama but are a 9-10 hour hike over 19km, with +/- 1600m. That’s significantly more difficult. You can have a look at my translation of <a href=\"https://cogley.jp/japan-mountain-hike-grading/\">Japan’s mountain grading system</a>, to see how hikes are graded in Japan and what makes a hike challenging or risky.</p>\n<p>So how was the trail? You start the climb by going up many, many stairs through a shopping district (where they sell famous Japanese top souvenirs) at the base of the mountain, stepping and stepping up to the cable car station, which wasn’t operating at 7am anyway. Once you get past the lower cable car station, you have a choice to make, between the feminine and masculine.</p>\n<p>Our daughter recommended I take the &ldquo;Onna-zaka&rdquo; (女坂), or &ldquo;women’s slope&rdquo;, up to the lower shrine, because she said &ldquo;Otoko-zaka&rdquo; (男坂), or &ldquo;man’s slope&rdquo; is just too precarious with uneven and crumbling steps. It turns out the &ldquo;Onna-zaka&rdquo; is more interesting anyway, as you can visit Oyama temple which is not accessible from the &ldquo;Otoko-zaka&rdquo;, and, see the &ldquo;nana fushigi&rdquo; or &ldquo;seven curiosities&rdquo; like the childrearing o-Jizo, the relief statue that was carved by a monk using only his fingernails, or the silent bridge (bad luck to talk as you pass over), as well as see some &ldquo;power spots&rdquo; like the &ldquo;married couple cedars&rdquo; or Roben falls.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t all culture. There were 山蛭 &ldquo;yamahiru&rdquo; mountain leeches, too. Well, I didn’t actually <em>see</em> any leeches, but there was a sign warning about them, and a tub of salt to use, to coat your socks and shoes with, so coat I did! A mountain-goer friend told me the Oyama area is one of the areas in Tanzawa with money, so they indeed take some measures against mountain leeches, but that other more backcountry destinations in Tanzawa don’t. He recalled he was shocked to find his shins all bloody one hike, from getting some of them on his shins. There’s even a nearby mountain called &ldquo;Mt. Leech&rdquo;, which, sounds like it’s not for the faint-hearted.</p>\n<p>I took a break at the beautiful lower shrine, after having ascended the women’s slope. I said a prayer at the shrine, and looked around a little bit. One of many things that stood out was a statue of two school children, looking determined and pointing into what I assume is a bright future, which has an inscription 輝け杉の子 &ldquo;kagayake, Sugi no Ko&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Shine! Children of the Cedars!&rdquo; The sign said it commemorates the 40th anniversary of when about 3000 children evacuated to Oyama during WWII, were returned to their families. Poignant to think that some of these kids had nothing to return to.</p>\n<p>From the &ldquo;Shimosha&rdquo; lower shrine, you start up what is now fewer stairs, and more trail, as you ascend to the summit. Recently a friend pointed out that the Tanazawa mountains were formed not by volcanic activity, but by tectonic plates pushing against each other, so the characteristic of the trail is a bit different. It’s not volcanic rock like Mt. Kintoki in Hakone, but more granite-like rocks between the roots and dirt. A little way after the lower shrine, there is a famous geological structure called the Botan Iwa 牡丹岩 or &ldquo;peony rocks&rdquo;, which is a big boulder structure you walk over, with round knobby protrusions between the size of a baseball and a softball, underfoot.</p>\n<p>Further along, there were a couple of beautiful views already, where I took a break thinking I would have a protein bar or energy gel. I felt fear set in as I had made a dumb and potentially dangerous mistake. You can access Mt. Oyama via bus from Isehara station on the Odakyu, but I parked in the 2nd lot, just next to the shopping district. And that’s where I left the sports gels and protein bars and rice ball I’d bought for this hike. Luckily, our daughter had given me some 塩分チャージ &ldquo;enbun charge&rdquo; salt candy &ldquo;just in case you get overheated&rdquo; which is a sugar tablet packed with salt and minerals, so I had two of those until I got to the summit. I was humbled and grateful that Oyama is a bit commercialized with a &ldquo;Chaya&rdquo; tea shop at the top. There I bought curry rice and a sports drink, thanking my lucky stars as I ate, that I would not be in danger of bonking on the way down. I did have enough water and sports drink packed with me, but I hope I never forget my food again!</p>\n<p>The route down was via &ldquo;Miharashidai&rdquo; which has a great view of Oyama itself and is a nice area to have a picnic, with a lot of picnic benches. There’s many signs on the way down, warning of either risk of slip/fall, or warning of falling rocks. The trail maintainers have affixed large steel cable nets to the mountain, especially where you’re navigating switchback as you descend. You can see that boulders have fallen into the nets, which was a little disconcerting. The app I use, Yamareco, showed a warning marker at one point (users can make a mark and explain why, which is visible on the trail in the app), saying that the trail was difficult to pass. There was a man and woman there that day, cutting trees that had fallen across the trail, using a handsaw. I got the go ahead and scrambled under on my hands and knees. Maybe that warning in the app will now disappear.</p>\n<p>Near the end, there’s a pretty waterfall called 二重滝 &ldquo;nijutaki&rdquo; or &ldquo;double falls&rdquo;, near another shrine also with that name. From there, you actually ascend a little again, and you’re back at the lower shrine in no time at all.</p>\n<p>Then, it was time to bust out my towel, which I sat on at a café while having a banana smoothie and a sausage. I was tired, so I chickened out of descending the &ldquo;Onna&rdquo; or &ldquo;Otoko&rdquo; slopes again, opting instead to take the cable car down past Oyama Temple, to the base. From there, it was back to the parking lot and back home.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, check out the route map on my <a href=\"https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5873530.html\">Yamareco activity URL</a>.

				"content_text": "On Sunday 27 August 2023, I challenged myself to an approx 5:45hr 6.8km solo hike in the Tanzawa range on a hot and humid day (it suddenly rained at the end), ascending about 905m up [Mt. Oyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_%C5%8Cyama_(Kanagawa)) starting in the shopping district around 7am, climbing up via the \"Onna-zaka\" (women’s slope) route to the summit, then descending about 630m down via Miharashidai to the \"Shimosha\" shrine area, and finally down by cable car. \n\n![Pin badge from Mt. Oyama shop, showing elevation and the name in Japanese and English, depicting a shrine and deer in a forest scene.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8053/2023/img-5241.jpg)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nMt. Oyama is considered holy and has significant and interesting history. It’s also known as \"Afuri Yama\", where \"Afuri\" refers to the rainy conditions, and \"Kunimi-yama\" the Guardian of the Land. The main shrine at the top is called \"Oyama Afuri Jinja Honsha\" (大山阿夫利神社 本社), and the one at the base near the top cable car station is \"Oyama Afuri Jinja Shimosha\" (大山阿夫利神社 下社), the \"lower shrine\". There is also \"Oyama Dera\" a Buddhist Temple at the first stop on the cable car, half way up to the lower shrine. \n\nIt may be somewhat crowded and fairly \"commercialized\" but Oyama’s a challenging enough intermediate hike nevertheless. If you’re new to mountain trekking, try a smaller peak first, such as Takao or Hakone’s Kintoki, before attempting 1,252m Oyama. Indeed, and true to its \"Afuri Yama\" name, this hike was sunny until it suddenly started raining after I got down, but you should be prepared for weather, even in summer. Oyama is located in the Tanzawa-Oyama Quasi National Park in northwest Kanagawa prefecture, with over 38,000 hectares of forest with various mountain hikes, dams, rivers, waterfalls and so on, so if you want more of a challenge, you can try hikes such as To-no-dake and Mt. Tanzawa. \n\nTo be more specific, it’s partially about the meters of elevation difference that make a hike easier or harder. Hikes in the Kamakura Alps are over rolling hills, 100 or 200m in height, so you get maybe +/-200 or 300m or so over the course of the hike. When you start actual \"Tozan\" (mountain climbing, where the main point is ascending a single or multiple peaks), like at Takao in Tokyo, Kintoki in Hakone, or something like Kurobi in Gunma, you are doing +/-500 or 600m. Then you start doing hikes where you’ve chosen a trail that requires +/-800 to 1000. Tanzawa’s Oyama is one such, as is Hakone’s Sengen or Myojingatake. More difficult are peaks like To-no-dake and Mt. Tanzawa, which are near Oyama but are a 9-10 hour hike over 19km, with +/- 1600m. That’s significantly more difficult. You can have a look at my translation of [Japan’s mountain grading system](https://cogley.jp/japan-mountain-hike-grading/), to see how hikes are graded in Japan and what makes a hike challenging or risky. \n\nSo how was the trail? You start the climb by going up many, many stairs through a shopping district (where they sell famous Japanese top souvenirs) at the base of the mountain, stepping and stepping up to the cable car station, which wasn’t operating at 7am anyway. Once you get past the lower cable car station, you have a choice to make, between the feminine and masculine. \n\nOur daughter recommended I take the \"Onna-zaka\" (女坂), or \"women’s slope\", up to the lower shrine, because she said \"Otoko-zaka\" (男坂), or \"man’s slope\" is just too precarious with uneven and crumbling steps. It turns out the \"Onna-zaka\" is more interesting anyway, as you can visit Oyama temple which is not accessible from the \"Otoko-zaka\", and, see the \"nana fushigi\" or \"seven curiosities\" like the childrearing o-Jizo, the relief statue that was carved by a monk using only his fingernails, or the silent bridge (bad luck to talk as you pass over), as well as see some \"power spots\" like the \"married couple cedars\" or Roben falls.\n\nIt wasn’t all culture. There were 山蛭 \"yamahiru\" mountain leeches, too. Well, I didn’t actually _see_ any leeches, but there was a sign warning about them, and a tub of salt to use, to coat your socks and shoes with, so coat I did! A mountain-goer friend told me the Oyama area is one of the areas in Tanzawa with money, so they indeed take some measures against mountain leeches, but that other more backcountry destinations in Tanzawa don’t. He recalled he was shocked to find his shins all bloody one hike, from getting some of them on his shins. There’s even a nearby mountain called \"Mt. Leech\", which, sounds like it’s not for the faint-hearted. \n\nI took a break at the beautiful lower shrine, after having ascended the women’s slope. I said a prayer at the shrine, and looked around a little bit. One of many things that stood out was a statue of two school children, looking determined and pointing into what I assume is a bright future, which has an inscription 輝け杉の子 \"kagayake, Sugi no Ko\" or, \"Shine! Children of the Cedars!\" The sign said it commemorates the 40th anniversary of when about 3000 children evacuated to Oyama during WWII, were returned to their families. Poignant to think that some of these kids had nothing to return to. \n\nFrom the \"Shimosha\" lower shrine, you start up what is now fewer stairs, and more trail, as you ascend to the summit. Recently a friend pointed out that the Tanazawa mountains were formed not by volcanic activity, but by tectonic plates pushing against each other, so the characteristic of the trail is a bit different. It’s not volcanic rock like Mt. Kintoki in Hakone, but more granite-like rocks between the roots and dirt. A little way after the lower shrine, there is a famous geological structure called the Botan Iwa 牡丹岩 or \"peony rocks\", which is a big boulder structure you walk over, with round knobby protrusions between the size of a baseball and a softball, underfoot. \n\nFurther along, there were a couple of beautiful views already, where I took a break thinking I would have a protein bar or energy gel. I felt fear set in as I had made a dumb and potentially dangerous mistake. You can access Mt. Oyama via bus from Isehara station on the Odakyu, but I parked in the 2nd lot, just next to the shopping district. And that’s where I left the sports gels and protein bars and rice ball I’d bought for this hike. Luckily, our daughter had given me some 塩分チャージ \"enbun charge\" salt candy \"just in case you get overheated\" which is a sugar tablet packed with salt and minerals, so I had two of those until I got to the summit. I was humbled and grateful that Oyama is a bit commercialized with a \"Chaya\" tea shop at the top. There I bought curry rice and a sports drink, thanking my lucky stars as I ate, that I would not be in danger of bonking on the way down. I did have enough water and sports drink packed with me, but I hope I never forget my food again! \n\nThe route down was via \"Miharashidai\" which has a great view of Oyama itself and is a nice area to have a picnic, with a lot of picnic benches. There’s many signs on the way down, warning of either risk of slip/fall, or warning of falling rocks. The trail maintainers have affixed large steel cable nets to the mountain, especially where you’re navigating switchback as you descend. You can see that boulders have fallen into the nets, which was a little disconcerting. The app I use, Yamareco, showed a warning marker at one point (users can make a mark and explain why, which is visible on the trail in the app), saying that the trail was difficult to pass. There was a man and woman there that day, cutting trees that had fallen across the trail, using a handsaw. I got the go ahead and scrambled under on my hands and knees. Maybe that warning in the app will now disappear. \n\nNear the end, there’s a pretty waterfall called 二重滝 \"nijutaki\" or \"double falls\", near another shrine also with that name. From there, you actually ascend a little again, and you’re back at the lower shrine in no time at all. \n\nThen, it was time to bust out my towel, which I sat on at a café while having a banana smoothie and a sausage. I was tired, so I chickened out of descending the \"Onna\" or \"Otoko\" slopes again, opting instead to take the cable car down past Oyama Temple, to the base. From there, it was back to the parking lot and back home. \n\nIf you're interested, check out the route map on my [Yamareco activity URL](https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5873530.html). Hope to see you on the trail some time! 🌋\n\n---- \nHere’s my assessment of this hike using the [Japan Mountain Hike Grading](https://cogley.jp/japan-mountain-hike-grading/) scales:\n\n<table>\n\t<caption>Japan Hike Grading Assessment</caption>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>\n\t\t\t\tRanking Criteria\n\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t<th>\n\t\t\t\tDetails\n\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t<th>\n\t\t\t\tLevel\n\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tStamina\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t(5.75×1.8) ＋ (6.8×0.3) ＋ (0.9×10) ＋ (0.63×0.6) ＝ 22\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tTechnical Difficulty\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tSome plunge/slip risk areas (well marked)\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n---- \nSee the [photo gallery](https://1drv.ms/a/s!Ag_R9efw_8fIg70tFsd93UEM-PPavA?e=nMrq6r)and [Yamareco activity record](https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5873530.html). \n\n_Route map, see also on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1CE-BvRxIKgw2QVdIjK4H5jnX65XIYdQ&usp=sharing) ([other hiking maps](https://cogley.jp/hiking-maps/) available too):_\n\n![Mt.

Although summer in Japan brings intense humidity and lots of pestering insects.</p>\n<p>From the placard at the summit, you&rsquo;ll read it gets its name &ldquo;Myojo&rdquo; from Venus, the morning or evening star. It&rsquo;s also known as Mt. Kuno, from its vicinity to the Kuno district, and Mt. Daimonji, from the main event at the annual Hakone Gora summer festival held on Aug 16th at the end of o-bon, when a giant 10m wide &ldquo;dai&rdquo; kanji symbol, 大, cut into the side of the mountain, is set alight. After the initial ascent, I got passed by a young fellow carrying a gas-powered weed whacker on his shoulder, then later ran into him and two other older men with various gardening gear, who said they were cleaning up the giant 大 in preparation for the festival. I was glad for my desk job right about then, but also a little jealous of such a cool activity prepping for such an important cultural event.</p>\n<p>The summit is pretty enough, with a manicured grassy open area (no toilet), and a small shrine next to the summit placard, but the views are not really spectacular. For that, hike to the next peak over, Mt. Myo-jin-gatake, or a little further on, to Mt. Kintoki. The views from the &ldquo;dai&rdquo; area are nice though, and you can see Gora, the ropeway, and Mt. Hakone and its surroundings quite well. To be honest, I just wanted to do a hike, so I picked this trail and this mountain, then figured out where I was when I got there. It was cool to learn where the giant 大 symbol is physically, see how it&rsquo;s maintained, and read a little about the mountain.</p>\n<p>There were no &ldquo;paving stone&rdquo; sections like you see on the Yusaka or &ldquo;Old Kamakura&rdquo; trail from Yumoto up to Mt. Sengen, but otherwise the trail was typical for this area: hard pack dirt with a lot of roots and rocks, mostly larger ones, and some steps made from cut logs. Also, I saw a sign again and finally figured out what it meant. The sign says to scoop up even a handful of dirt from the &ldquo;water channel&rdquo;, and what is meant by that, is there are channels cut across the trail to allow water to pass, which get filled with dirt and silt. They are asking hikers to grab a handful and toss it aside, so I did. You can see the sign and said water channel in the photos.</p>\n<p>The descent was uneventful except for one area where it was too much of a drop (for me) to maneuver myself down, so I dropped my poles and pack down onto a flat area, turned around, and somehow lowered myself down. I find fear creeping into my thoughts in these situations, so I know I won&rsquo;t be hiking something like Mt. Tsurugi anytime soon! You&rsquo;ll probably find trekking poles to be useful on the descent.</p>\n<p>I was on the trail by 6:45am, and while there was a lot of bird song, which was pleasant, there were also a lot of flying insects this time. Some bees, some hornets, and some large flying insects which were really persistent; they looked like large flies with a white spot on their abdomen. A friend told me about a saying that goes something like &ldquo;the mountains are ours in the mornings but theirs at night.&rdquo; He said he started out on some Hakone trail around noon, and said he felt monkey eyes on him as he descended near dusk. Said it was a creepy experience he doesn&rsquo;t want to repeat. Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ll leave before sunrise in the future too.</p>\n<p>As you get to the trail head after descending, you start seeing signs for the bus stop and public toilets.

				"content_html": "<p>On Sunday 30 July 2023, I challenged myself with a ~10 km solo day hike in Hakone on a hot summer&rsquo;s day, ascending the Yusaka trail from Hakone Yumoto station, ascending 850m over about 7km to <a href=\"https://hakone-japan.com/discover/national-park/area-information/highlights/mt-sengen/\">Mt Sengen</a> 802m (浅間山 せんげんさん) and Mt Takanosu 834m (鷹巣山 たかのすやま) with the (nonexistent) Takanosu Castle ruins, then descending 400m to the highlight, Chisuji Falls (千条の滝 ちすじのたき) at the 8.5km mark, and proceeding another couple of km over roads to Gora.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Mts Sengen and Takanosu are related, in that Sengen used to be known as &ldquo;Lower Takanosu&rdquo; until the Edo Period. A Shinto shrine was built, and it was given the common name &ldquo;Sengen&rdquo; (also pronounced &ldquo;Asama&rdquo;) which you see here and there in Japan. There&rsquo;s one near where I live, a shrine on the highest hill around. When I decided on this hike, I was hoping to see something interesting historically, and while I read that Mt Takanosu is where the ruins of Takanosu castle are located, there&rsquo;s actually nothing there with the sign saying basically &ldquo;the castle was around here, somewhere&rdquo;. This castle is said to have been the Hojo Clan stronghold to protect against Toyotomi Hideyoshi&rsquo;s attack on Odawara in 1590 (Tensho 18), and since the sign at Mt Sengen also says Takanosu Castle was located there, perhaps both mountains were part of the fortifications.</p>\n<p>At any rate, after ~7km of ascending over 2 hours and 20 min, the two summits are pretty enough, but they are kind of nestled amongst other mountains and so unlike Mt Kintoki for instance, there&rsquo;s no spectacular view. There are no toilets or anything else either, just a couple of picnic tables.

The unique feature of this trail was &ldquo;paving stones&rdquo; sections which you can see in one of the photos I snapped. I read a Japanese review of this trail, and the person said the stones are mossy and slippery when wet. They were dry for me, but I could see this being a pretty precarious trail in the rain. The trail is definitely not as rocky as Mt. Kintoki, and there are no areas with chains or ropes needed, but it&rsquo;s a longer ascent of about 850m, compared to the 600m I did when I went up Mt. Kintoki, so you&rsquo;re feeling it by the time you summit.</p>\n<p>On critters, there are signs warning about bears, and though I haven&rsquo;t seen a bear in this area, the sign says if you do, stay calm, don&rsquo;t run or turn your back on them, and just leave the area where the bear is. It&rsquo;s not yet wasp season, which is later summer to early fall, but there were a number of wasps flying. Last week on Mt Kintoki, I was serenaded by cicadas, but on this hike, it was bird song punctuated by occasional angry wasp sounds. With wasps, you must avoid black clothing and perfume, and if you encounter any, just stay calm and get out of there, avoiding trying to swat at them.</p>\n<p>Especially around the summits of Sengen and Takanosu, the trail is really pleasant with grasses along the way, and I can imagine this hike is especially lovely in November. I could see momiji and sakura trees, so depending on the time of year, it&rsquo;s got to be breathtaking. I can imagine that allergy season would be a challenge though, with all the cedar trees!</p>\n<p>While descending I was feeling like I should have gone for a hike with a better view, but, when I got to Chisuji falls, it was all worth it. What a beautiful place, and my photos don&rsquo;t do it justice. As you approach, you can hear the river and falls, and the trail bottoms out at a bridge, which when crossed is right there at the falls. A friendly older lady hiker was there when I got there, and she rinsed her face in the pool of water at the falls, so I did the same. It was ice cold, and perfect after that long hike. The falls are close to the road, and so are accessible to families with kids. A couple and there young child came up the road to take a look just as I was leaving.</p>\n<p>From the falls, it quickly turns to concrete roads as you go down to Kowakidani station, then on to Gora. It was a super hot day, so I got a cold drink at a vending machine, and had a quick toilet break at the toilet near the combini (marked on the Google map). At Gora, I had a cold strawberry dessert to cool down, then took the train down to Tonosawa. From there, I walked to <a href=\"https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/\">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal.

				"content_text": "On Sunday 30 July 2023, I challenged myself with a ~10 km solo day hike in Hakone on a hot summer's day, ascending the Yusaka trail from Hakone Yumoto station, ascending 850m over about 7km to [Mt Sengen](https://hakone-japan.com/discover/national-park/area-information/highlights/mt-sengen/) 802m (浅間山 せんげんさん) and Mt Takanosu 834m (鷹巣山 たかのすやま) with the (nonexistent) Takanosu Castle ruins, then descending 400m to the highlight, Chisuji Falls (千条の滝 ちすじのたき) at the 8.5km mark, and proceeding another couple of km over roads to Gora. \n\n<!-- more -->\n\nMts Sengen and Takanosu are related, in that Sengen used to be known as \"Lower Takanosu\" until the Edo Period.

				"content_html": "<p>On Saturday 22 July 2023, I challenged a solo day hike up Mt Kintoki (金時山 きんときさん) in Hakone, on a perfect day for hiking, and was rewarded with incredible views from the summit. This mountain has maybe the best view of Mt Fuji, too. It was a good physical challenge for this 57 yr old who mostly jogs and walks the dog. My legs held up better this time compared to my <a href=\"https://blog.cogley.jp/44839/mt-kurobi-first-real-mountain-trek-experience\">first adventure up Mt Kurobi in Gunma</a>, probably because I&rsquo;ve tried to be more active since then, doing several less-challenging hikes in the meantime.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Mt Kintoki at 1,213m is another &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; mountain, and the 6.2km route I slowly hiked over about 5 hours with breaks, had an elevation change of +-620m , but unlike Mt Kurobi, it gets steep near the top, with some areas having ropes or chains like an easy graded &ldquo;via ferrata&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t feel panic in any areas, but there were a few spots where you could get seriously injured if you fell. I helped a fellow middle aged guy get up after he slipped coming down. He was fine, but he and his climbing partner both looked exhausted, and it made me nervous.</p>\n<p>The mountain&rsquo;s formal name is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ashigara\">Mt Ashigara</a> (足柄山 あしがらさん), but most people call it Mt Kintoki, from the legendary warrior Kintoki Sakata, aka &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintar%C5%8D\">Kintaro</a>&rdquo; (金太郎 きんたろう) who grew up on the mountain. Part-way up from the shrine trailhead, you can see a massive boulder that is said to have been split by Kintaro with his axe (now that&rsquo;s bad-ass). There&rsquo;s also an axe prop at the summit, so you can make like the folk hero. Additionally, as this is one of the most climbed mountains in Japan, the routes are well-maintained, and there are bio toilets (100 yen to use) and tea shops serving light food and drink and selling souvenirs at the summit. Read more in English <a href=\"https://hakone-japan.com/discover/national-park/activities/recommended-hiking-trails/mt-kintoki-course/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/fuji-hakone-izu/see-and-do/mount-kintoki-hiking-trail/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The trail is well maintained indeed, but note that it&rsquo;s rather rocky in many parts. I did this hike in &ldquo;trail shoes&rdquo;, but I could feel my feet getting a little bruised up here and there. I probably would have worn my hiking boots if I were going after a rainy period. The trail is hard pack dirt with a lot of roots, and rocks ranging in size from about a baseball to larger boulders. You ascend stepping on or between the large rocks, onto placed logs, or using tree roots as steps, helping yourself up with the occasional fixed rope or chain. There were some areas with big piles of smaller baseball-sized rocks, which looked to just be there to try to have a more &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; trail with fewer slip hazards. The rocks themselves appear to be either granite or volcanic &ldquo;pumice&rdquo;-like rock.</p>\n<p>I started at the Shrine trail head, and looking at the signs for Mt Kintoki there, it gave a time of 75 min to the summit, but someone had cheekily scrawled a &ldquo;90&rdquo; with a paint pen. I imagine the people who maintain the trails and are involved in the sign-making, are more experience hikers than the rest of us schlubs. It took me about 90 min up to the summit, where the view was just fantastic. You can use the toilet for 100 yen, or get a light meal at one of the two Chaya (茶屋). I got shaved ice with stewed sweet beans with (I think) condensed milk, saving the rice ball I&rsquo;d bought for later. The guys who were working in the Chaya were friendly and spoke some English. An old regular came in, plopped down his two bamboo sticks he was using as hiking poles, and started helping the fellows behind the counter. They asked me to sign their English guestbook so I did, but I imagine nobody can read my chicken scratches.</p>\n<p>After about 30 min rest, it took another 60 min to get to Mt. Nagao (長尾山 ながおさん) a smaller peak on the way down, then 30 min to Otome Pass (乙女峠 おとめとうげ) where I had another brief rest and ate, then a final 70 min to Otome Trailhead (乙女口 おとめぐち) where I exited onto route 138. While there are indeed bus stops near there, the Sengoku bus stop with frequent service back to Hakone Yumoto, is a couple km down the road.</p>\n<p>On access in general, there are a few ways to get there, even a bus out of Shinjuku that goes directly down to the Hakone area. Because I live relatively close to the area, I took JR down to Odawara, then got the T-line Tougendai Bus (T桃源台線バス とうげんだいばす) from outside Odawara station, which goes up the mountain via Hakone Yumoto. It&rsquo;s a ~40min trip up winding roads to the Sengoku Bus Stop (仙石 せんごく), and then a 1km walk from there to the trailhead at Kintoki Shrine. There&rsquo;s a convenience store between the bus stop and the trailhead as well, so you can buy energy gels or protein bars etc. Note you can take the funicular train from Odawara, but you&rsquo;d have to transfer to the same bus anyway at Hakone Yumoto, so it&rsquo;s easiest to get on at Odawara. Coming back, though, I got on the bus at Sengoku and got off part-way down at Kami-Tonosawa, then walked from there to <a href=\"https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/\">Hakone Yuryo</a>, a day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal. (It&rsquo;s a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don&rsquo;t admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and went back up on JR.</p>\n<p>While it&rsquo;s assuredly &ldquo;touristy&rdquo;, a bit like Mt Takao, Kintoki&rsquo;s climbable even in winter without too much trouble. Anytime you&rsquo;re in the mountains, however touristy it may seem, you still need to be prepared. I always bring a small emergency kit, extra clothes and rain gear, and enough food. It might be an exaggeration but &ldquo;better safe than sorry&rdquo;, right? At any rate, if you&rsquo;re interested, you can see the route I hiked, from my <a href=\"https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5741990.html\">Yamareco activity URL</a> map.

Coming back, though, I got on the bus at Sengoku and got off part-way down at Kami-Tonosawa, then walked from there to [Hakone Yuryo](https://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/), a day-spa onsen for a post-hike soak and a meal. (It's a fantastic facility, but like many others, they don't admit people with tattoos FYI) From Hakone Yuryo, I used their convenient shuttle to go to Hakone Yumoto, then took the funicular to Odawara and went back up on JR. \n\nWhile it's assuredly \"touristy\", a bit like Mt Takao, Kintoki's climbable even in winter without too much trouble. Anytime you're in the mountains, however touristy it may seem, you still need to be prepared. I always bring a small emergency kit, extra clothes and rain gear, and enough food. It might be an exaggeration but \"better safe than sorry\", right? At any rate, if you're interested, you can see the route I hiked, from my [Yamareco activity URL](https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5741990.html) map. Hope to see you on the trail some time! 🌋\n\n---- \nSee the [photo gallery](https://1drv.ms/a/s!Ag_R9efw_8fIg7gkba5QrvYEJeT1ng?e=qT1bbL) and [Yamareco activity record](https://www.yamareco.com/modules/yamareco/detail-5741990.html). \n\n_Route map, click for Google Maps:_\n\n[![Mt.

It was supposed to be very hot that day, and remembering how waterlogged I was the last hike in trousers and seeing some trail runners in shorts, I opted for running shorts and extra bug spray. On my way by 5:30am, I rode the scooter to, and parked at <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/Z6g8WEd2t8K4D7FN6\">a 24 hour lot at JR Ofuna</a>. From there, I took the JR train two stops south to Zushi and went out the north exit.</p>\n<p>After firing up Geographica and Apple Watch Fitness (Hiking), I started jogging at around 6:30am, and it was overcast but already high humidity. Until you get to the Nagoe Kiridoshi trailhead, it&rsquo;s just normal concrete roads, so I decided to take a peek at a recommended temple, Gandenji, which was beautiful and very quiet. There were some cool-looking stone stairs going up past the temple, but we&rsquo;ll leave those for another day. I turned back down the path, jogged back to the main route 311 again, and went up toward where the trailhead for the Nagoe Kiridoushi should be.</p>\n<p>Google Maps Directions said I had to go through the famous &ldquo;ghost spot&rdquo; Kotsubo tunnel to get to the stairs that lead up to the trailhead so through I went. I&rsquo;m happy to report I did not see any ghosts, feel any odd cool breezes, or hear any sudden buddhist chanting or jingly bell sounds or anything like that, go figure! Once through the tunnel, the stairs are up around the bend to the left. You schlep up <em>quite</em> a lot of stairs, up and around, and after going through a neighborhood at the top, there&rsquo;s the trailhead at the edge. The sign says you can access the Nagoe Kiridoushi from here.</p>\n<p>The trail itself is typical of the &ldquo;Kamakura Alps&rdquo; area, hardpack with roots and rocks, and in the case of these trails, pretty overgrown with lots of fallen trees to clamber under or over. There are signs here and there warning about snakes, so you want to keep an eye peeled, although I did not see any. It was not muddy, I assume due to the recent heat. Trail runner shoes are fine for this trail. If you don&rsquo;t like bugs, bring poles to wave at the plants that you&rsquo;re going to be brushing against. I&rsquo;d also say this trail is dog friendly, except it might be a challenge with the fallen trees, and I&rsquo;d wait until the fall months to bring along Taro.</p>\n<p>Once on the trail, there were some explanatory signs for the Nagoe Kiridoshi saying it and others were the primary route for people going up Sagami bay to Kamakura, until the JR Yokosuka line was built. It&rsquo;s just stunning to think of how much work it would have been to physically cut a pass in a mountain like that. Really impressive.</p>\n<p>The Mandarado Yagura tombs were closed, so I did not get to see those, but I did pass through another impressive area, the Osarubatake Quarry. It was mistakenly thought this might have been a defense structure for Kamakura, but excavation and research in Heisei showed it was a quarry for stones used in works around Kamakura. It&rsquo;s 800m long and about 5 to 10m high, and leaves a lasting impression.</p>\n<p>A bit farther on, there&rsquo;s a small sign that just said &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; so I took off up a side trail, to the top of a peak, from where you could see the beach near Kamakura, and Enoshima island in the distance. It was windy and chilly up there, a relief because the clouds had cleared by then and it was starting to get hot.</p>\n<p>From the panoramic view, it was down into the Zushi Highland neighborhood area (there&rsquo;s a toilet at the trailhead), then right back up onto the Heisei Pilgrimage Road trail. It&rsquo;s a lot of up and down, and the trail was pretty overgrown, with a lot of fallen trees here and there along the way. You exit the trail and go down the street, where you run into the &ldquo;Dengakuzushi no michi&rdquo; road near the Nameri river.

				"content_html": "<p>On Sunday 2nd July 2023, I challenged myself with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1AojU_s53wMsfTyJR4EfE8ODwG5T0Rog&amp;usp=sharing\">this ~12km solo hike</a> from JR Kounandai to JR Kamakura, via the Kamakura Ten&rsquo;en Hiking Trail in the &ldquo;Kamakura Alps&rdquo;.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>After delivering the pamphets and papers from the chonai meeting the night before to our group&rsquo;s mailboxes, I set out at about 6:30 am on the scooter, and parked at <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/Z6g8WEd2t8K4D7FN6\">a 24 hour lot at JR Ofuna</a>. From there, I took the train two stops up the Negishi line to Kounandai, bought a couple of protein bars at the combini, and exited. Outside the station, I turned on Geographica and Apple Watch Fitness (Hiking), and set off toward the trailhead which is up the hill from that station.</p>\n<p>It was already hot by the time I got started, around 30C with high humidity around 90%. The week before I had taken our dog Maru on a shorter hike in these same woods, and got bit by a &ldquo;buyo&rdquo; black fly. Not recommended, would not repeat. This time, thanks to the hive mind on social, I used bug repellent and brought hakka (peppermint) oil to spritz with along the way.</p>\n<p>The trailhead wasn&rsquo;t immediately apparent. From Konandai 5 intersection, you turn in before the fire dep&rsquo;t, then take the first left up the steep path that goes behind the recyling center. On Google Maps it kind of looks like you can get to the trail from behind the recyling center, but you can&rsquo;t. The link above shows how you need to go.</p>\n<p>At first the trail is just a concrete path, but that slowly changes to trail as you go along up toward the Isshindo plaza. About the trail, it&rsquo;s typical for trails in this area: hardpack dirt with a lot of roots and some rocks, and areas that are just a massive boulder you walk over. So many people have passed over the years, that there are grooves worn into the rock. It had rained the day before, so there was a considerable amount of mud the entire trip, getting worse as I went along. I was glad for long hiking pants, though there were plenty of trail runners in shorts. Today I wore trail running shoes, not boots, and while boots would have been better in the mud, the trail running shoes are much better for this kind of surface in general. I&rsquo;m currently wearing Columbia Montrail&rsquo;s which I like as much as the Altra LonePeaks I had before.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t trail run, but I fast-walked or jogged where I could, from Isshindo, past Enkaizan, Shodo Citizens Forest, Kanazawa Citizens Forest, the Sekiyaoku viewing platform, making it to the Yokohama Nature Observation Forest and Shikai Plaza. Shikai is the border between Yokohama and Kamakura, and from there it&rsquo;s a short 30 min or so to Kamakura Ten&rsquo;en. There&rsquo;s a rest house at Ten&rsquo;en where you can get food like Oden or just sit if you get a drink from the vending machine (it&rsquo;s a private rest house) but this time I did not go there. I went up to Ten&rsquo;en itself, which is <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/WH5CJH1LFHxbUGgh7\">the highest point in Yokohama city</a> and has a nice view (around here, the trail kind of straddles the border between Yokohama and Kamakura).</p>\n<p>From Ten&rsquo;en I had to decide whether to press on to Kenchoji near JR Kita-Kamakura or to go down to Zuizenji. The sign said 90 min to Kenchoji so I opted to turn left and go down to Zuizenji instead, a much shorter trip. Though shorter, the descent was a bit gnarly, with a lot of slippery knee-stressing natural steps. By that time it was about 9km in, and I was feeling it. My legs were starting to shake and I had to pause a few times and just take it slow. There&rsquo;s a sign at some point that says it&rsquo;s 400m to Zeizenji, so I&rsquo;m thinking, oh, easy, but no, nature laughs. That&rsquo;s where the descent really started. If you&rsquo;re young or in great shape, it&rsquo;s probably not a problem, but I was glad when that 400m was over!</p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t visit Zuizenji, but just walked down the hill toward Kamakuragu (toilets there), helping a tourist find parking a long the way. On the way to Kamakura station, there&rsquo;s a German café &ldquo;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/wbQKYqvnCxz296b88\">Bergfeld</a>&rdquo; which serves an excellent open face sandwich lunch set. Light, and just right after this hike.</p>\n<p>From Bergfeld, it was a short trip through incredible crowds to get to JR Kamakura, and then it was two stops back to Ofuna and home by scooter. All in all, a great but exhausting day!

From there, I took the train two stops up the Negishi line to Kounandai, bought a couple of protein bars at the combini, and exited. Outside the station, I turned on Geographica and Apple Watch Fitness (Hiking), and set off toward the trailhead which is up the hill from that station.  \n\n\nIt was already hot by the time I got started, around 30C with high humidity around 90%. The week before I had taken our dog Maru on a shorter hike in these same woods, and got bit by a \"buyo\" black fly. Not recommended, would not repeat. This time, thanks to the hive mind on social, I used bug repellent and brought hakka (peppermint) oil to spritz with along the way. \n\nThe trailhead wasn't immediately apparent. From Konandai 5 intersection, you turn in before the fire dep't, then take the first left up the steep path that goes behind the recyling center. On Google Maps it kind of looks like you can get to the trail from behind the recyling center, but you can't. The link above shows how you need to go. \n\nAt first the trail is just a concrete path, but that slowly changes to trail as you go along up toward the Isshindo plaza. About the trail, it's typical for trails in this area: hardpack dirt with a lot of roots and some rocks, and areas that are just a massive boulder you walk over. So many people have passed over the years, that there are grooves worn into the rock. It had rained the day before, so there was a considerable amount of mud the entire trip, getting worse as I went along. I was glad for long hiking pants, though there were plenty of trail runners in shorts. Today I wore trail running shoes, not boots, and while boots would have been better in the mud, the trail running shoes are much better for this kind of surface in general. I'm currently wearing Columbia Montrail's which I like as much as the Altra LonePeaks I had before. \n\nI can't trail run, but I fast-walked or jogged where I could, from Isshindo, past Enkaizan, Shodo Citizens Forest, Kanazawa Citizens Forest, the Sekiyaoku viewing platform, making it to the Yokohama Nature Observation Forest and Shikai Plaza. Shikai is the border between Yokohama and Kamakura, and from there it's a short 30 min or so to Kamakura Ten'en. There's a rest house at Ten'en where you can get food like Oden or just sit if you get a drink from the vending machine (it's a private rest house) but this time I did not go there. I went up to Ten'en itself, which is [the highest point in Yokohama city](https://goo.gl/maps/WH5CJH1LFHxbUGgh7) and has a nice view (around here, the trail kind of straddles the border between Yokohama and Kamakura).\n\nFrom Ten'en I had to decide whether to press on to Kenchoji near JR Kita-Kamakura or to go down to Zuizenji. The sign said 90 min to Kenchoji so I opted to turn left and go down to Zuizenji instead, a much shorter trip. Though shorter, the descent was a bit gnarly, with a lot of slippery knee-stressing natural steps. By that time it was about 9km in, and I was feeling it. My legs were starting to shake and I had to pause a few times and just take it slow. There's a sign at some point that says it's 400m to Zeizenji, so I'm thinking, oh, easy, but no, nature laughs. That's where the descent really started. If you're young or in great shape, it's probably not a problem, but I was glad when that 400m was over!  \n\n\nI didn't visit Zuizenji, but just walked down the hill toward Kamakuragu (toilets there), helping a tourist find parking a long the way. On the way to Kamakura station, there's a German café \"[Bergfeld](https://goo.gl/maps/wbQKYqvnCxz296b88)\" which serves an excellent open face sandwich lunch set. Light, and just right after this hike. \n\nFrom Bergfeld, it was a short trip through incredible crowds to get to JR Kamakura, and then it was two stops back to Ofuna and home by scooter. All in all, a great but exhausting day! Hope to see you on the trail! 🥾\n\n---- \nSee the [photo gallery](https://1drv.ms/a/s!Ag_R9efw_8fIg7YKmxrvJs-koua_sw). \n\n[![A ~12km hike from JR Kounandai to JR Kamakura, on the \"Kamakura Ten'en Hiking Trail\" in the Kamakura Alps. ](https://cdn.some.pics/rick/64a2058f68892.png)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1AojU_s53wMsfTyJR4EfE8ODwG5T0Rog&usp=sharing)\n\n![Ten’en on the Kamakura hiking trail is the highest point In Yokohama ](https://cdn.some.pics/rick/64a1072c94679.jpg)\n\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been 30 years since we got married. To celebrate, we booked a tour of Shimane and Tottori prefectures, and had a fantastic time. We did a tour so we could not have to plan, and drink without worrying about someone having to drive. We took the bullet train from Shin Yokohama to Okayama, then went on the tour bus to Adachi Museum, then to Tamazukuri Onsen for the first night. The second day was on to the Shimane Winery, Izumo Taisha shrine, then Misasa Onsen. The final day was the old warehouse town of Kurayoshi, the Tottori Port, and finally the Tottori Sand Dunes before heading back to Okayama. I&rsquo;ll give some details in this post. ♨️🫃🏼</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"getting-there\">Getting There</h3>\n<p>We left our house at 7am, and made our way to JR Shin-Yokohama station, to get on the bullet train. We bought our lunches, boarded the Nozomi on time, and just enjoyed the trip. The tour included reserved &ldquo;green car&rdquo; (first class) tickets, and the seats were quite nice, comfortable, and included outlets to charge the devices. The Nozomi is an express service, and stops in only a handful of places. We got to Okayama in no time, then walked a ways to the bus terminal. We stowed our bags, boarded, and we were off. Next stop, the Adachi Museum.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adachi-museum\">Adachi Museum</h3>\n<p>We arrived after a couple hours in the bus. The garden is so well maintained and lovely, you can see why it wins awards, and the Takeuchi Seiho retrospective, the Waterscapes exhibit and the Rosanjin Hall all were such a pleasure to get to view up close. Such masterful detail. The Adachi Museum of Art was a sensory overload and well worth visiting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3644.jpg\" alt=\"Adachi Museum Garden\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"tamazukuri-onsen\">Tamazukuri Onsen</h3>\n<p>Next, on to an Japanese style &ldquo;Ryokan&rdquo; inn, in the the hot spring town Tamazukuri Onsen. Kasuien Minami was a wonderful experience. A traditional feel while being modern at the same time, the staff, the room, the baths, the award-winning garden and the food were all top notch. We had about 17 hours here, so we took advantage of the large bathing complex several times, enjoyed a huge multi-course &ldquo;kaiseki&rdquo; meal, and just relaxed. We got up early, took another bath, and had probably the best breakfast we&rsquo;d ever experienced in any hotel or inn. The amount of choice was positively decadent. Just amazing. Afterwards, we got ready, checked out, and took a walk around the town to see the local deity statuary all around the river walk area. It was cool that they had QR codes to let you view a translation of the Japanese signage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3671.jpg\" alt=\"Kasuien Minami Foyer\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3673.jpg\" alt=\"Kasuien Minami Café\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3676.jpg\" alt=\"Kasuien Minami Garden\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3689.jpg\" alt=\"Tamazukuri Onsen Town\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"shimane-winery-and-train-to-izumo-taisha\">Shimane Winery and Train to Izumo Taisha</h3>\n<p>The next stop was the Shimane Winery for lunch and a little tasting. We were pleasantly surprised that the lunch was so good. It was meant to be quick, but, it was kaiseki quality, and the wagyu steak and sashimi was divine. The winery gift shop had a tasting bar which was closed, so we made do with some free samples of the various wines, and settled on a pair of wines that are specially made for November, when the gods come to visit Izumo Taisha.</p>\n<p>Then a short jaunt around an interesting lake just off shore, to the train station. The train line we took uses recycled train cars from Tokyo, so we immediately felt nostalgic riding this train. The train has a rare switchback station, and so the train gets turned around so that if you were facing the lake, you&rsquo;re now facing the mountains. It took about an hour on the train to get to the station nearest Izumo Taisha shrine, but the scenery was really worth it - really lovely, and felt like a Miyazaki anime.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3708.jpg\" alt=\"Train to Izumo Taisha\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"izumo-taisha\">Izumo Taisha</h3>\n<p>If Ise Jingu shrine is the number one since it houses Amaterasu, Izumo Taisha, or more correctly &ldquo;Izumo Ohyashiro&rdquo;, is the clear number two, housing the rest of the many, many gods. In Japan, the old way to refer to the tenth lunar month (generally equivalent to November) is 神無月 &ldquo;kannazuki&rdquo; or &ldquo;the month without gods&rdquo; while at Izumo Taisha, it&rsquo;s known as 神在月 or &ldquo;kamiarizuki&rdquo; or &ldquo;the month <em>with</em> gods&rdquo;. We visited right during the crowded festival week, welcoming the gods back to the shrine. It was explained that the gods gather to hold discussions on matchmaking, determining the fates of their worshippers. Ceremonies and festivals held during this time are supposed to be sober, quiet affairs so as not to disturb their deliberations.</p>\n<p>Our guide was a young person in her 20s from Okayama who said she was the oldest of 8 siblings, and she was really knowledgeable. She obviously had studied quite hard, and gave us an endless stream of informational anecdotes and tidbits about everything along the way in the bus, but also of course about Izumo Taisha. If I remember right, she said it was the only shrine where you go down into it, rather than up a bunch of steps. The four great torii gates were magnificent, although the largest one was under wraps, being restored or repaired in some way. The great しめ縄 &ldquo;shimenawa&rdquo; which you&rsquo;ll see in the pictures was truly imposing, especially when you&rsquo;re right under it making your offerings. As we explored, we also saw a very large flag of Japan, along with several wedding processions.</p>\n<p>One point about making an offering at Izumo Taisha is, the process is two bows, <em>four</em> claps, and one bow, rather than the customary two claps at most shrines. The lay explanation for the 4 claps is given as standing for 幸せ, “shi-a-wa-se” or happiness, but the real etymology is supposed to be the saying 一霊四魂, or the four key aspects of a spirit: action, peace, loving protection &amp; knowledge. I dug into this a little, and it appears that although this is only done on one day of the year now at a spring festival, the custom used to be <em>eight</em> claps, because 8 on its side looks like the infinity symbol.</p>\n<p>Other thing we learned was, while the best coins to put in the offering box are either 5 or 50 yen ones (the ones with the holes) since &ldquo;go en&rdquo; means good relationships, you can also put combinations like a 10 yen and 1 yen coin, or a 100 yen and a 10 yen coin. I&rsquo;ll need to study about this a bit more.</p>\n<p>At any rate, remembering &ldquo;shi-a-wa-se&rdquo; is easy enough, and my wife and I prayed at several locations in the grounds for our daughters to have good fortune in their lives and relationships, as well as for our own health.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3728.jpg\" alt=\"Izumo Taisha Queue\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3734.jpg\" alt=\"Izumo Taisha Shimenawa\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3813.jpg\" alt=\"Rick and A at Izumo Taisha\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"misasa-onsen\">Misasa Onsen</h3>\n<p>Next stop, Misasa Onsen. Izanro Iwasaki in Misasa Onsen is a wonderful older ryokan establishment, with friendly staff, clean rooms and facilities, really comfortable futon beds and pillows, fantastic food and a lovely garden that you can go out into. We even saw a frog in a pond in the garden, how appropriate for Japan. The views from our room were just super, and we could see the wide river and mountains from it. There’s a public bath right near the bridge, and we could see some tiny naked bathers enjoying it from our room. The bathing area is really large with many baths, and even has a radon steam room, the area being famous for that (there’s even a Marie Curie statue). The lounge area outside the baths on the first floor has coffee milk in a vending machine, and some delicious local ice cream to enjoy while you lounge around.</p>\n<p>Tottori had a big quake in 2016, and there was unfortunate damage then to a famous teahouse in the garden. Maybe related, but the little town area on the other side of the river had some shuttered inns and looked pretty run down, but, there was a quaint little “ashiyu” foot bath over there, which we wished we had time for. We got a lot more soaking and eating and wandering in, before we left on the bus for the &ldquo;white warehouse&rdquo; area around 10am.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3747.jpg\" alt=\"Izanro Iwasaki Foyer\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3746.jpg\" alt=\"Izanro Iwasaki Steak\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"kurayoshi-shirakabe-white-warehouse-district\">Kurayoshi Shirakabe White Warehouse District</h3>\n<p>Next we did a one hour tour at Kurayoshi &ldquo;Shirakabe&rdquo; White Warehouses in Tottori, and it was fascinating! The warehouses were from various eras from Edo to Meiji, with glass that was warped due to the manufacturing methods of the day. The guide showed us all the various differences from era to era, from building heights to construction styles, which was really cool. The red &ldquo;Sesshu&rdquo; tiles looked lovely against the white walls and black burnt cedar wood skirtings. It was great to learn about the architectural style of these protected buildings.</p>\n<p>One oddity was that several shops had life sized &ldquo;sexy anime mascot girl&rdquo; cutouts in their store fronts. Maybe &ldquo;otaku&rdquo; types would like it, but, these were jarring and added nothing to the history or attraction of the place. Our regret here was that we wished the tour let us have time to browse a bit as there was a craft beer brewery shop, a cool looking café, gallery, local goods, and others which were beckoning. Also it was raining. They say “<em>in Tottori, even if you forget your bento, don’t forget an umbrella</em>” because the wet weather there is so unpredictable.</p>\n<p>Next was lunch at the port, and on to the dunes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3762.jpg\" alt=\"Sesshu Tile\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"tottori-dunes\">Tottori Dunes</h3>\n<p>The Tottori sand dunes, our last stop, were quite impressive as well. We got a brief explanation from the “dune meister” then set off to climb the big one that we saw from the top of the stairs. It&rsquo;s about 63m the meister said, and about twice the height of Jockey&rsquo;s Ridge in Kitty Hawk for comparison. The tour had us wear plastic shop bags over our shoes, but not many other people were wearing them and sand got in anyway. It was chilly weather in November, so the jackets we had came in handy. It had rained earlier so the sand was supposedly a little easier to walk on, but it was a bit aerobic to get to the top.</p>\n<p>We walked about 1.5km on sand (harder than it seems) then headed back toward the bus, stopping for coffee in the shop in the cool building in the parking lot.</p>\n<p>Then it was back on the bus, and back to Okayama to get some last minute omiyage gifts, then head home on the ever-reliable shinkansen.</p>\n<p>What a great way to spend 3 days out of our 30 year history so far. Here&rsquo;s to 30 more! ❤️</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3805.jpg\" alt=\"Tottori Dunes A Hooray\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Photos by Rick Cogley</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

We got a lot more soaking and eating and wandering in, before we left on the bus for the \"white warehouse\" area around 10am. \n\n![Izanro Iwasaki Foyer](https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3747.jpg)\n\n![Izanro Iwasaki Steak](https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3746.jpg)\n\n### Kurayoshi Shirakabe White Warehouse District\nNext we did a one hour tour at Kurayoshi \"Shirakabe\" White Warehouses in Tottori, and it was fascinating! The warehouses were from various eras from Edo to Meiji, with glass that was warped due to the manufacturing methods of the day. The guide showed us all the various differences from era to era, from building heights to construction styles, which was really cool. The red \"Sesshu\" tiles looked lovely against the white walls and black burnt cedar wood skirtings. It was great to learn about the architectural style of these protected buildings.\n\nOne oddity was that several shops had life sized \"sexy anime mascot girl\" cutouts in their store fronts. Maybe \"otaku\" types would like it, but, these were jarring and added nothing to the history or attraction of the place. Our regret here was that we wished the tour let us have time to browse a bit as there was a craft beer brewery shop, a cool looking café, gallery, local goods, and others which were beckoning. Also it was raining. They say “*in Tottori, even if you forget your bento, don’t forget an umbrella*” because the wet weather there is so unpredictable.\n\nNext was lunch at the port, and on to the dunes. \n\n![Sesshu Tile](https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3762.jpg)\n\n### Tottori Dunes\nThe Tottori sand dunes, our last stop, were quite impressive as well. We got a brief explanation from the “dune meister” then set off to climb the big one that we saw from the top of the stairs. It's about 63m the meister said, and about twice the height of Jockey's Ridge in Kitty Hawk for comparison. The tour had us wear plastic shop bags over our shoes, but not many other people were wearing them and sand got in anyway. It was chilly weather in November, so the jackets we had came in handy. It had rained earlier so the sand was supposedly a little easier to walk on, but it was a bit aerobic to get to the top. \n\nWe walked about 1.5km on sand (harder than it seems) then headed back toward the bus, stopping for coffee in the shop in the cool building in the parking lot. \n\nThen it was back on the bus, and back to Okayama to get some last minute omiyage gifts, then head home on the ever-reliable shinkansen. \n\nWhat a great way to spend 3 days out of our 30 year history so far. Here's to 30 more! ❤️\n\n![Tottori Dunes A Hooray](https://static.cogley.info/img/30th/Cogley-3th-Anniversary-Shimane-Tottori_3805.jpg)\n\n---- \n<small><em>\n\nPhotos by Rick Cogley\n\n</small></em>\n\n",

You have plenty of compute power, so why not take advantage of it and use something better than `ls`.\n\n---- \nWhen you cannot dig `dig` for cli dns lookup, you might try « [`dog`](https://dns.lookup.dog) », written in Rust by Benjamin Sago @cairnrefinery (who also wrote the lovely `exa`) or « [`q`](https://github.com/natesales/q) », written in Go by Nate Sales. 😎\n\nI especially like how you can output json from `dog` for consumption by another program for say, pushing to a database: \n\n\t{\n\t> dog esolia.com A AAAA MX TXT --json | jq\n\t\"responses\": [\n\t  {\n\t    \"additionals\": [],\n\t    \"answers\": [\n\t      {\n\t        \"address\": \"99.84.138.103\",\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"ttl\": 26,\n\t        \"type\": \"A\"\n\t      },\n\t      {\n\t        \"address\": \"99.84.138.27\",\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"ttl\": 26,\n\t        \"type\": \"A\"\n\t      },\n\t      {\n\t        \"address\": \"99.84.138.119\",\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"ttl\": 26,\n\t        \"type\": \"A\"\n\t      },\n\t      {\n\t        \"address\": \"99.84.138.118\",\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"ttl\": 26,\n\t        \"type\": \"A\"\n\t      }\n\t    ],\n\t    \"authorities\": [],\n\t    \"queries\": [\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"type\": 1\n\t      }\n\t    ]\n\t  },\n\t  {\n\t    \"additionals\": [],\n\t    \"answers\": [],\n\t    \"authorities\": [],\n\t    \"queries\": [\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"type\": 28\n\t      }\n\t    ]\n\t  },\n\t  {\n\t    \"additionals\": [],\n\t    \"answers\": [\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"exchange\": \"alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"preference\": 5,\n\t        \"ttl\": 300,\n\t        \"type\": \"MX\"\n\t      },\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"exchange\": \"alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"preference\": 5,\n\t        \"ttl\": 300,\n\t        \"type\": \"MX\"\n\t      },\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"exchange\": \"aspmx.l.google.com.\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"preference\": 1,\n\t        \"ttl\": 300,\n\t        \"type\": \"MX\"\n\t      },\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"exchange\": \"aspmx2.googlemail.com.\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"preference\": 10,\n\t        \"ttl\": 300,\n\t        \"type\": \"MX\"\n\t      },\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"exchange\": \"aspmx3.googlemail.com.\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"preference\": 10,\n\t        \"ttl\": 300,\n\t        \"type\": \"MX\"\n\t      }\n\t    ],\n\t    \"authorities\": [],\n\t    \"queries\": [\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"type\": 15\n\t      }\n\t    ]\n\t  },\n\t  {\n\t    \"additionals\": [],\n\t    \"answers\": [\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"message\": \"google-site-verification=K4Vo3d0t6V11dXkV2nWU-H0srafI_UVPtlCvKvN2npQ\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"ttl\": 300,\n\t        \"type\": \"TXT\"\n\t      },\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"message\": \"keybase-site-verification=JldStq9k7lM6uosSy-za3ilkJo0mlnqSulhYIGMgbpQ\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"ttl\": 300,\n\t        \"type\": \"TXT\"\n\t      }\n\t    ],\n\t    \"authorities\": [],\n\t    \"queries\": [\n\t      {\n\t        \"class\": \"IN\",\n\t        \"name\": \"esolia.com.\",\n\t        \"type\": 16\n\t      }\n\t    ]\n\t  }\n\t]\n\t}\n\n---- \n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515704089429-fd06e6668458?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=3870&q=80)\n\n<small><em>\n\nSocial Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@badashproducts?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Ash Edmonds</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/code?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>\n\n</small></em>\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I finally got my proper Japan driver&rsquo;s license, and what an ordeal it&rsquo;s been. Fasten your seatbelts for this one and just note that you must convert, and cannot drive on an IDP for more than one year. Anyway, here goes:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"the-incident\">The incident</h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been in Japan since 1987 and did not drive for the first 4 or 5 years. I always have kept my US license current, and after getting married, got and started using an international license. Never had a problem buying cars, mopeds, or insurance using the international license. They expire yearly, and recently had always bought them online via AAA, and they&rsquo;d come in the post a couple weeks later.</p>\n<p>I had a couple fender benders and a couple citations over the years, but nothing major, and no cop ever questioned the international license. But about three years ago, it was my lucky day I guess: got pulled over and the cop told me you can only use an int&rsquo;l for 1 year, meaning, I was driving without a license or guilty of &ldquo;mumenkyo unten&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Cue getting carted off to the police station in the back of a cruiser, a scary interview process, signing a statement, getting my wife pulled in as well (so sorry) and interviewed because the car&rsquo;s in her name, then finally released. We got called back separately for more interviews and finally they decided to just limit it to me. They could have charged and fined her too, for allowing an unlicensed person to drive her car. We would have really been in trouble had they not been charitable to us in the weeks following.</p>\n<p>I was feeling sick for a long time after this. Fearing the absolute worst because this offense can come with prison time, I contacted a lawyer. He told me if I wasn&rsquo;t in cuffs and locked up, it wasn&rsquo;t an arrest per se, albeit of course a serious issue. This eased my mind somewhat. He told me to just be sincere and honest, and advised me not to change the story.</p>\n<p>In about a month I had to appear before the prosecutor &amp; judge, paid a 300,000 JPY fine, and had to go to a day&rsquo;s training regarding the rules: there would be no chance of getting a license for 2 years, mandatory 2 day course for people who lose their license. After the course they interview you to make sure you understand, and the cop told it&rsquo;s easiest to stay in US for 90d over a three year period, then convert. Conversion means you hand in a translation of your license and proof that you&rsquo;ve been in the US (not sure re other countries) for the required 90 days over three years, take an eye test and simple 10 question written test, and take a driving test. I hear they fail you a few times, but it&rsquo;s a cheap process compared to going to a school. Some countries and some US states (OH, WA, HI I think?) are exempt from the testing; you just do an eye test and <em>bam</em>, you&rsquo;re licensed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"going-to-school\">Going to school</h3>\n<p>I started trying to get the 90 days in the US, and was up to 60 days, but COVID messed with those plans. Eventually my wife got tired of driving us everywhere so she insisted I just pay to take the course at a school. I went to the certified &ldquo;kounin&rdquo; school in Totsuka where we are, and to get your regular car license at any of such school is about 300,000 JPY.</p>\n<p>There are schools that offer English language courses but they are not so convenient for me, so I opted for Japanese lessons with English tests. My Japanese is good, but my kanji reading is too slow to be competitive in a test situation. It&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> of training, and textbook facts you have to memorize. I know how to drive so I had to tamp down the annoyance, and try to keep a beginners&rsquo; mindset. The biggest challenge was, I&rsquo;m 56, so memorizing is not my strong suit right about now.</p>\n<p>My &ldquo;stance&rdquo; during all this was to keep an earnest sincerity, and kind of over-exaggerate all the checks and so on, that you&rsquo;re meant to do. Basically, when I took the driver test in PA in the US in 81, it was like getting tossed off a cliff. Our gym teacher at HS was the driving instructor, and while we did have a primitive driving simulator in the basement of the HS, the training was little to non-existent.</p>\n<p>So for this class in Japan, I decided to make the best of it, ask a ton of questions and get them to explain a lot. Especially with regard to driving skills that, while I could do them, I can&rsquo;t say I felt confident about. Due to the step by step nature of the training and the repetition, I have to say I&rsquo;m a lot more confident about things like backing up, parallel parking and so on.</p>\n<p>The training is in two stages and breaks down like this:</p>\n<h4 id=\"stage-1\">Stage 1</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Take a psych test to find out your &ldquo;driver personality&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Classes on basic knowledge</li>\n<li>Practice driving basics inside the school grounds on their test course</li>\n<li>Pass practice tests using &ldquo;mantensama&rdquo; online site</li>\n<li>Pass &ldquo;koukasokutei&rdquo; 50-question true-false test after all classwork, which focuses on the classes you&rsquo;ve taken so far</li>\n<li>Pass &ldquo;mikiwame&rdquo; driving test, which says you&rsquo;re ready for the actual test</li>\n<li>Pass the &ldquo;karimen&rdquo; driving test</li>\n<li>Get your &ldquo;karimen&rdquo; learner&rsquo;s permit, with which you can drive on the streets when accompanied by person with a license</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"stage-2\">Stage 2</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Classes on intermediate knowledge</li>\n<li>Practice driving basics outside the school on regular roads</li>\n<li>First aid &ldquo;set&rdquo; class, 3 hr</li>\n<li>Other &ldquo;set&rdquo; classes, such as &ldquo;expressway driving&rdquo; class, followed by actual expressway driving, or &ldquo;emergency maneuvers&rdquo; followed by some fun experiences like taking a curve at higher speed than normal or, slamming on the brakes to see how the car reacts at 40 kph</li>\n<li>Pass practice tests using &ldquo;mantensama&rdquo; online site</li>\n<li>Pass &ldquo;koukasokutei&rdquo; 90-question true-false test after all classwork, which focuses on stage 2 classroom learning with a little review of stage 1 learning, and is similar to the actual licensing exam</li>\n<li>Pass &ldquo;mikiwame&rdquo; driving test, which says you&rsquo;re ready for the actual test</li>\n<li>Pass &ldquo;sotsugyo&rdquo; driving test</li>\n<li>Graduation ceremony, explanation of taking the written test at the DMV, and get your graduation certificate, and some other papers you need to present when taking the written test</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot, and it&rsquo;s really designed to get a person with no experience at all, up to speed to be able to drive relatively safely. For that, I think it serves its purpose well. Despite knowing how to drive, I found myself nodding my head in agreement with the instructors, many around my age, when they were emphasizing some point to the classes (mostly late teens early 20s) about how dangerous an accident can be, or whatnot. Most of the many, many instructors I interacted with were excellent ranging in age from late 20s to around 60.</p>\n<p>The two hardest parts for me were first, the memorization (it&rsquo;s just not so easy at 56) and second, not exceeding the posted speed limit. Thirty kph really feels too slow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remedial-training\">Remedial training</h3>\n<p>Before I could get the karimen learner&rsquo;s permit, I had to take the remedial two day course for people who have had their license confiscated - when I scheduled it, the person arranged it so I could take the course more near my house, which was a relief. I arrived at the school near Kamioooka at 8am, and my classmates were a guy who drove drunk and another who got caught speeding way over the limit.</p>\n<p>The initial psych test they have you take on day one at the regular school gives you an idea of how you&rsquo;ll react in various situations. They ask many questions designed to tease out your personality, and also give tests that are designed to induce stress, as in, making the same mark on paper as fast as you can for a one minute period: how many X&rsquo;s can you make, crossing a backward slash.</p>\n<p>I did not do &ldquo;well&rdquo; on this initial test, partially because of irritation about it, and partially because the explanations were fast and I wasn&rsquo;t following well. Then, surprise, surprise, there was another one during this two day course!</p>\n<p>However, this time I knew what to expect, and did much better, with a normal result. The instructor also explained it better as well. He was really encouraging and got us psyched up to do it, and all of us got an acceptable result.</p>\n<p>I think also it helped that this instructor, an ex cop, was empathetic and funny. He knew this course and the whole thing about losing your license would have been a stress and an embarrassment, and basically handled the whole two days with humor. Of the three of us, one fellow was at the point I was at, just before the &ldquo;karimen&rdquo; and the other fellow had already graduated. The instructor joked that he was going to make the graduate backup through the &ldquo;crank&rdquo; (a series of narrow 90 degree turns you have to negotiate), and that if he couldn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d have to tell his school to rescind the graduated status. Sounds mean, but it was funny and broke the tension.</p>\n<h3 id=\"formal-steps-and-graduating\">Formal steps and graduating</h3>\n<p>Regarding the two driving tests you take during the course of the schoolwork, they are formal and there are specific sets of steps that you must complete. This was a bit of a challenge because before each test, the instructors are explaining very quickly, and if your listening comprehension is not 100% on that day, you might miss something. I asked them to repeat just in case I missed; things like &ldquo;so, after we stop, we&rsquo;re to turn off the engine and get out of the car, checking behind, otherwise it&rsquo;s a fail, right?&rdquo; I imagine that might have helped another student who missed the point, since they said you&rsquo;d fail if you missed it.</p>\n<p>Regarding the &ldquo;sets of steps&rdquo; I mentioned, I mean a process like, before starting, you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inspect the vehicle,</li>\n<li>get in checking to the rear,</li>\n<li>confirm parking brake and that the gear is in P,</li>\n<li>press engine button twice / turn key to aux,</li>\n<li>confirm mirrors and seat position,</li>\n<li>verbally say you&rsquo;re ready,</li>\n<li>fasten seatbelt,</li>\n<li>turn on engine,</li>\n<li>put gear in D,</li>\n<li>release side brake,</li>\n<li>check mirrors,</li>\n<li>signal,</li>\n<li>turn and check blind spot,</li>\n<li>go.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or, when changing lanes or turning, it&rsquo;s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>check back mirror,</li>\n<li>check relevant side mirror,</li>\n<li>signal,</li>\n<li>check blind spot,</li>\n<li>turn</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found it was useful to do some image training, thinking about these steps, and then do them every time I drove. You can get in a lot of practice before the test, if you memorize it up front and just repeatedly do it how they expect. It&rsquo;s a bit of a challenge to unlearn shortcuts you&rsquo;ve been taking for many years, though.</p>\n<p>The final driving test was a lot easier than I thought it would be, and you&rsquo;re paired up with another person. In my case, my partner was around 20, had never driven, and passed even though though they cut off a car coming straight while they were turning right. When the instructors were coming out to give us the results after taking the final test, I overheard my partner say &ldquo;I know I screwed up badly&hellip;&rdquo;, and the instructor respond &ldquo;yes, but you have done everything else right so far, so I am going to pass you. Just please be careful in those situations since you can&rsquo;t know what someone else will do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Once you graduate, you don&rsquo;t need to go back to the school, but you&rsquo;ve just got the the final written test, which is only given at the DMV test center. In our case, it&rsquo;s the Kanagawa Driver Center near Futamatagawa station in Yokohama. Before you could just show up and take the test, but due to COVID, now you register online and there&rsquo;s a bit of a wait. We had to wait a month. I graduated on 22 Feb and took the written test on 22 Mar 2022. During the month of waiting, unfortunately I could feel the facts kind of slipping away out of my brain, so I studied regularly using mantensama, and my own notes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-final-written-test\">The final written test</h3>\n<p>The test center was a madhouse, but thankfully everyone was masked. Reception was supposed to be from 8:30 to 9:00am, so I arrived at 8:15. They were already processing people in, and it was already very crowded. When I got to the front of the line, I handed over my various papers including graduation certificate, proof I had taken the 2-day remedial course, and answers on a questionnaire about not having epilepsy or narcolepsy. I emphasized that I wanted to take the test in English, and the cop doing my check-in told me I need to fill out the form in English instead. So I did that, re-queued, and then got passed over to the eye test line.</p>\n<p>The eye test was literally 30 seconds: you look into a machine like they have at the ophthalmologist, and say whether the opening in the C is up, down, left or right. Then you get directed to a waiting room. In my case, since my test was to be in English, they directed me to wait with other such testees, and in a few minutes another official came out to check our paperwork and direct us to the test rooms.</p>\n<p>After a bit more waiting, and people scrambling down to the convenience store on the first floor to buy pencils (!) since they no longer provide them due to COVID, they passed the tests out and walked us through how to fill out the answer sheet. In the case of the foreign language testers, there were special codes to enter, so an official came over and filled bits of the sheet in for us.</p>\n<p>The test in English had a different odd grammar from the odd grammar of the practice tests, so that was a bit of a jolt. The test is 90 questions in 50 min, and I used up 40 of the 50 min, handed it in, then went to a special kiosk to get a barcode slip with the license PIN on it, and pay the 2100 yen for the license fee. Actually, as is typical in Japan, you buy stamps to affix to a physical form.</p>\n<p>Once everyone was done with the test I went back in and sat down, and waited for the result. They display the &ldquo;jukenbango&rdquo; numbers of the people who passed on the screen. Maybe 10 of about 100 people in the room failed, and were told to leave the room. But, there&rsquo;s my number, a pass!</p>\n<p>Next they explain the rest of the process, including optional membership in the &ldquo;safety club&rdquo; which is 1500 yen for the license validity period, and has the main benefit of giving you a kind of &ldquo;fast pass&rdquo; letting you skip the line when you renew the next time. Sounds like a good deal to me, so I paid it. Maybe 5 of 90 of the others joined.</p>\n<p>Finally, they came in with the licenses, and call people by the number of their birthday month, so since I&rsquo;m Jan, I was in the first group. You get the license, hand in your permit, then leave. One last step is, to use a kiosk to check the info in the license. All good! Now I just need to remember to put the &ldquo;beginner mark&rdquo; magnets on the car any time I drive. Luckily the school gave us these as a graduation present.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interesting-trivia\">Interesting trivia</h3>\n<p>Congrats, you made it to the end! Some interesting facts I picked up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can be cited for &ldquo;failure to render first aid&rdquo; if you don&rsquo;t use your first aid knowledge during an accident, whether it&rsquo;s your fault or not.</li>\n<li>If your car runs out of gas or breaks down on the expressway, you can be cited for &ldquo;failure to maintain your vehicle&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>You can be cited for staying in the passing lane on the expressway.</li>\n<li>If you ride the expressway, it&rsquo;s a requirement to have one of those triangle reflectors to put out in case of a breakdown.</li>\n<li>Getting a citation or having points subtracted during the first year is a problem; you can be made to take a two day remedial class, then redo all the tests. What a pain. Drive carefully that first year!</li>\n<li>If you get another more advanced license, like &ldquo;jun-chuugata&rdquo; (small truck), during the first year, the aforementioned strictness is applied to the more advanced of whatever license you have. So, if you have &ldquo;jun-chuugata&rdquo; and get cited while driving your normal car, that does not count as a citation against your first-year &ldquo;beginner period&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>If you are in an accident even if it&rsquo;s minor, never run and always call the police. Something that seems minor in the context of your home country is probably not seen as minor in Japan. The example given was bumping mirrors. They are designed to fold back, but even that is classed as an &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and you still have to call the cops, even if both drivers agree it&rsquo;s nothing. Better to do it right, than to risk having someone come at you later.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1449965408869-eaa3f722e40d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Social Photo by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why kei<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unsplash<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

I always have kept my US license current, and after getting married, got and started using an international license. Never had a problem buying cars, mopeds, or insurance using the international license. They expire yearly, and recently had always bought them online via AAA, and they'd come in the post a couple weeks later. \n\nI had a couple fender benders and a couple citations over the years, but nothing major, and no cop ever questioned the international license. But about three years ago, it was my lucky day I guess: got pulled over and the cop told me you can only use an int'l for 1 year, meaning, I was driving without a license or guilty of \"mumenkyo unten\". \n\nCue getting carted off to the police station in the back of a cruiser, a scary interview process, signing a statement, getting my wife pulled in as well (so sorry) and interviewed because the car's in her name, then finally released. We got called back separately for more interviews and finally they decided to just limit it to me. They could have charged and fined her too, for allowing an unlicensed person to drive her car. We would have really been in trouble had they not been charitable to us in the weeks following. \n\nI was feeling sick for a long time after this. Fearing the absolute worst because this offense can come with prison time, I contacted a lawyer. He told me if I wasn't in cuffs and locked up, it wasn't an arrest per se, albeit of course a serious issue. This eased my mind somewhat. He told me to just be sincere and honest, and advised me not to change the story. \n\nIn about a month I had to appear before the prosecutor & judge, paid a 300,000 JPY fine, and had to go to a day's training regarding the rules: there would be no chance of getting a license for 2 years, mandatory 2 day course for people who lose their license. After the course they interview you to make sure you understand, and the cop told it's easiest to stay in US for 90d over a three year period, then convert. Conversion means you hand in a translation of your license and proof that you've been in the US (not sure re other countries) for the required 90 days over three years, take an eye test and simple 10 question written test, and take a driving test. I hear they fail you a few times, but it's a cheap process compared to going to a school. Some countries and some US states (OH, WA, HI I think?) are exempt from the testing; you just do an eye test and _bam_, you're licensed. \n\n### Going to school\nI started trying to get the 90 days in the US, and was up to 60 days, but COVID messed with those plans. Eventually my wife got tired of driving us everywhere so she insisted I just pay to take the course at a school. I went to the certified \"kounin\" school in Totsuka where we are, and to get your regular car license at any of such school is about 300,000 JPY. \n\nThere are schools that offer English language courses but they are not so convenient for me, so I opted for Japanese lessons with English tests. My Japanese is good, but my kanji reading is too slow to be competitive in a test situation. It's a _lot_ of training, and textbook facts you have to memorize. I know how to drive so I had to tamp down the annoyance, and try to keep a beginners' mindset. The biggest challenge was, I'm 56, so memorizing is not my strong suit right about now. \n\nMy \"stance\" during all this was to keep an earnest sincerity, and kind of over-exaggerate all the checks and so on, that you're meant to do. Basically, when I took the driver test in PA in the US in 81, it was like getting tossed off a cliff. Our gym teacher at HS was the driving instructor, and while we did have a primitive driving simulator in the basement of the HS, the training was little to non-existent. \n\nSo for this class in Japan, I decided to make the best of it, ask a ton of questions and get them to explain a lot. Especially with regard to driving skills that, while I could do them, I can't say I felt confident about. Due to the step by step nature of the training and the repetition, I have to say I'm a lot more confident about things like backing up, parallel parking and so on. \n\nThe training is in two stages and breaks down like this: \n\n#### Stage 1\n1. Take a psych test to find out your \"driver personality\"\n2. Classes on basic knowledge\n3. Practice driving basics inside the school grounds on their test course\n4. Pass practice tests using \"mantensama\" online site\n5. Pass \"koukasokutei\" 50-question true-false test after all classwork, which focuses on the classes you've taken so far\n6. Pass \"mikiwame\" driving test, which says you're ready for the actual test\n7. Pass the \"karimen\" driving test\n8. Get your \"karimen\" learner's permit, with which you can drive on the streets when accompanied by person with a license\n\n#### Stage 2\n1. Classes on intermediate knowledge\n2. Practice driving basics outside the school on regular roads\n3. First aid \"set\" class, 3 hr\n4. Other \"set\" classes, such as \"expressway driving\" class, followed by actual expressway driving, or \"emergency maneuvers\" followed by some fun experiences like taking a curve at higher speed than normal or, slamming on the brakes to see how the car reacts at 40 kph\n5. Pass practice tests using \"mantensama\" online site\n6. Pass \"koukasokutei\" 90-question true-false test after all classwork, which focuses on stage 2 classroom learning with a little review of stage 1 learning, and is similar to the actual licensing exam\n7. Pass \"mikiwame\" driving test, which says you're ready for the actual test\n8. Pass \"sotsugyo\" driving test\n9. Graduation ceremony, explanation of taking the written test at the DMV, and get your graduation certificate, and some other papers you need to present when taking the written test\n\nThat's a lot, and it's really designed to get a person with no experience at all, up to speed to be able to drive relatively safely. For that, I think it serves its purpose well. Despite knowing how to drive, I found myself nodding my head in agreement with the instructors, many around my age, when they were emphasizing some point to the classes (mostly late teens early 20s) about how dangerous an accident can be, or whatnot. Most of the many, many instructors I interacted with were excellent ranging in age from late 20s to around 60. \n\nThe two hardest parts for me were first, the memorization (it's just not so easy at 56) and second, not exceeding the posted speed limit. Thirty kph really feels too slow. \n\n### Remedial training\nBefore I could get the karimen learner's permit, I had to take the remedial two day course for people who have had their license confiscated - when I scheduled it, the person arranged it so I could take the course more near my house, which was a relief. I arrived at the school near Kamioooka at 8am, and my classmates were a guy who drove drunk and another who got caught speeding way over the limit.\n\nThe initial psych test they have you take on day one at the regular school gives you an idea of how you'll react in various situations. They ask many questions designed to tease out your personality, and also give tests that are designed to induce stress, as in, making the same mark on paper as fast as you can for a one minute period: how many X's can you make, crossing a backward slash. \n\nI did not do \"well\" on this initial test, partially because of irritation about it, and partially because the explanations were fast and I wasn't following well. Then, surprise, surprise, there was another one during this two day course!\n\nHowever, this time I knew what to expect, and did much better, with a normal result. The instructor also explained it better as well. He was really encouraging and got us psyched up to do it, and all of us got an acceptable result. \n\nI think also it helped that this instructor, an ex cop, was empathetic and funny. He knew this course and the whole thing about losing your license would have been a stress and an embarrassment, and basically handled the whole two days with humor. Of the three of us, one fellow was at the point I was at, just before the \"karimen\" and the other fellow had already graduated. The instructor joked that he was going to make the graduate backup through the \"crank\" (a series of narrow 90 degree turns you have to negotiate), and that if he couldn't, he'd have to tell his school to rescind the graduated status. Sounds mean, but it was funny and broke the tension. \n\n### Formal steps and graduating\nRegarding the two driving tests you take during the course of the schoolwork, they are formal and there are specific sets of steps that you must complete. This was a bit of a challenge because before each test, the instructors are explaining very quickly, and if your listening comprehension is not 100% on that day, you might miss something. I asked them to repeat just in case I missed; things like \"so, after we stop, we're to turn off the engine and get out of the car, checking behind, otherwise it's a fail, right?\" I imagine that might have helped another student who missed the point, since they said you'd fail if you missed it.\n\nRegarding the \"sets of steps\" I mentioned, I mean a process like, before starting, you:\n\n* inspect the vehicle, \n* get in checking to the rear, \n* confirm parking brake and that the gear is in P, \n* press engine button twice / turn key to aux, \n* confirm mirrors and seat position, \n* verbally say you're ready, \n* fasten seatbelt, \n* turn on engine, \n* put gear in D, \n* release side brake, \n* check mirrors, \n* signal, \n* turn and check blind spot, \n* go. \n\nOr, when changing lanes or turning, it's: \n\n* check back mirror, \n* check relevant side mirror, \n* signal, \n* check blind spot, \n* turn\n\nI found it was useful to do some image training, thinking about these steps, and then do them every time I drove. You can get in a lot of practice before the test, if you memorize it up front and just repeatedly do it how they expect. It's a bit of a challenge to unlearn shortcuts you've been taking for many years, though. \n\nThe final driving test was a lot easier than I thought it would be, and you're paired up with another person. In my case, my partner was around 20, had never driven, and passed even though though they cut off a car coming straight while they were turning right. When the instructors were coming out to give us the results after taking the final test, I overheard my partner say \"I know I screwed up badly...\", and the instructor respond \"yes, but you have done everything else right so far, so I am going to pass you. Just please be careful in those situations since you can't know what someone else will do.\" \n\nOnce you graduate, you don't need to go back to the school, but you've just got the the final written test, which is only given at the DMV test center. In our case, it's the Kanagawa Driver Center near Futamatagawa station in Yokohama. Before you could just show up and take the test, but due to COVID, now you register online and there's a bit of a wait. We had to wait a month. I graduated on 22 Feb and took the written test on 22 Mar 2022. During the month of waiting, unfortunately I could feel the facts kind of slipping away out of my brain, so I studied regularly using mantensama, and my own notes. \n\n### The final written test\nThe test center was a madhouse, but thankfully everyone was masked. Reception was supposed to be from 8:30 to 9:00am, so I arrived at 8:15. They were already processing people in, and it was already very crowded. When I got to the front of the line, I handed over my various papers including graduation certificate, proof I had taken the 2-day remedial course, and answers on a questionnaire about not having epilepsy or narcolepsy. I emphasized that I wanted to take the test in English, and the cop doing my check-in told me I need to fill out the form in English instead. So I did that, re-queued, and then got passed over to the eye test line. \n\nThe eye test was literally 30 seconds: you look into a machine like they have at the ophthalmologist, and say whether the opening in the C is up, down, left or right. Then you get directed to a waiting room. In my case, since my test was to be in English, they directed me to wait with other such testees, and in a few minutes another official came out to check our paperwork and direct us to the test rooms.  \n\n\nAfter a bit more waiting, and people scrambling down to the convenience store on the first floor to buy pencils (!) since they no longer provide them due to COVID, they passed the tests out and walked us through how to fill out the answer sheet. In the case of the foreign language testers, there were special codes to enter, so an official came over and filled bits of the sheet in for us. \n\nThe test in English had a different odd grammar from the odd grammar of the practice tests, so that was a bit of a jolt. The test is 90 questions in 50 min, and I used up 40 of the 50 min, handed it in, then went to a special kiosk to get a barcode slip with the license PIN on it, and pay the 2100 yen for the license fee. Actually, as is typical in Japan, you buy stamps to affix to a physical form. \n\nOnce everyone was done with the test I went back in and sat down, and waited for the result. They display the \"jukenbango\" numbers of the people who passed on the screen. Maybe 10 of about 100 people in the room failed, and were told to leave the room. But, there's my number, a pass! \n\nNext they explain the rest of the process, including optional membership in the \"safety club\" which is 1500 yen for the license validity period, and has the main benefit of giving you a kind of \"fast pass\" letting you skip the line when you renew the next time. Sounds like a good deal to me, so I paid it. Maybe 5 of 90 of the others joined. \n\nFinally, they came in with the licenses, and call people by the number of their birthday month, so since I'm Jan, I was in the first group. You get the license, hand in your permit, then leave. One last step is, to use a kiosk to check the info in the license. All good! Now I just need to remember to put the \"beginner mark\" magnets on the car any time I drive. Luckily the school gave us these as a graduation present. \n\n### Interesting trivia\nCongrats, you made it to the end! Some interesting facts I picked up: \n\n* You can be cited for \"failure to render first aid\" if you don't use your first aid knowledge during an accident, whether it's your fault or not. \n* If your car runs out of gas or breaks down on the expressway, you can be cited for \"failure to maintain your vehicle\".\n* You can be cited for staying in the passing lane on the expressway. \n* If you ride the expressway, it's a requirement to have one of those triangle reflectors to put out in case of a breakdown. \n* Getting a citation or having points subtracted during the first year is a problem; you can be made to take a two day remedial class, then redo all the tests. What a pain. Drive carefully that first year! \n* If you get another more advanced license, like \"jun-chuugata\" (small truck), during the first year, the aforementioned strictness is applied to the more advanced of whatever license you have. So, if you have \"jun-chuugata\" and get cited while driving your normal car, that does not count as a citation against your first-year \"beginner period\". \n* If you are in an accident even if it's minor, never run and always call the police. Something that seems minor in the context of your home country is probably not seen as minor in Japan. The example given was bumping mirrors. They are designed to fold back, but even that is classed as an \"accident\" and you still have to call the cops, even if both drivers agree it's nothing. Better to do it right, than to risk having someone come at you later. \n\n---- \n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1449965408869-eaa3f722e40d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80)\n\n<small><em>\n\nSocial Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@whykei?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">why kei</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/driver-license?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>\n\n</small></em>\n\n\n",

You can use it to focus attention where your executives can provide the most help: getting problems unstuck. \n\nThat said, there will always be someone who will be a tool about why you're not supplying a detailed Gantt, but don't buckle to that pressure; it’s a fool's errand. \n\nIn the end, satisfy the real and pressing requirements of your projects, and stop fiddling with your tools. \n\n---- \n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1503791228404-a79884146f98?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2256&q=80)\n\n<small><em>\n\nSocial Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mattartz?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Matt Artz</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/tool?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>\n\n</small></em>\n\n",
